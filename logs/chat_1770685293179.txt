[*9269] 🐎: !!!!!!!!!
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: There exists a privileged elite whose power is structural rather than deriving from personal merit.
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: This elite congregates within a figurative "island" largely detached from the wider OWOT community.
[*8563] textstein: hes not talking about me
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: A powerful clique is thus formed, engaging in regulatory capture to push for tighter restrictions on the freedom of the many to serve the interests of the few.
[8563]: ok fr tho are you doing ok hacker
[8563]: dude becoming the larping king
[6278]: HoiWorldOfLew
[*9385] tulpamancia: Comorr?
[6278]: Catha’vi is a child groomer
[*616] (Kat's Server) kat :3: do yall think one of them single board computers can host an owot server
[*616] (Kat's Server) kat :3: or smth that can connect to an owot client
[6278]: I think you are mentally ill
[6278]: Never mind, I didn’t mean that
[6278]: I’m certain you could get it working
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: This power imbalance stems from the average lower-class individual's perceived lack of leverage and the disproportionate presence of the exclusive elite in the eyes of the ruling class.
[8567]: Which users do you consider to be the ruling class here?
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: Admins and moderators.
[8567]: I agree with you, but I don’t feel but there’s anything that will be done
[8567]: FP considers himself untouchable, despite not giving a shit about the site anymore
[*1431] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: hi
[*1431] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: :>
[8567]: Hello
[8567]: Are you ready to hate me for not being a woke plural system?
[*1431] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: what
[8567]: We non-woke plural systems, deserve subjugation
[8552]: do the right thing fp
[8552]: yagton must be removed
[*1431] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: what is blud talking about
[8567]: I wouldn’t mind one bit if yagton vanished off the Internet, I haven’t seen them do one positive thing for this site
[8552]: yagton literally posted an HRT guide for kids on the discord
[8552]: he literally sent scantily clad pictures of himself to kids on the discord
[8552]: if it was anyone else fp
[8552]: you would have banned them long ago
[581]: Someone is being transphobic on the main page chat
[581]: They are probably from the sharty
[*1431] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: anons gonna anon
[*6366] Prophetbot: [Hello OWOT, I'm Prophetbot! Want To Hear Something Interesting? Say "-motd"!]
[*6366] Prophetbot: [Hello OWOT, I'm Prophetbot! Want To Hear Something Interesting? Say "-motd"!]
[7305]: i'm with mhz on this one
[7305]: look at /owotd
[7305]: more creepy stories about yagton
[2921]: mhz is for pedophiles
[2921]: but yes
[7305]: yeah i mean
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > an HRT guide for kids(there are only teens on the discord) on the discord
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: what about it?
[7305]: distasteful i know
[7305]: but true
[2921]: Children should not be making DIY chemicals to impact their bodies
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: they should
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: the second a cis person takes hrt they'd feel immense gender dysphoria, which is why men (not trans women) aren't prescribed estrogen
[7305]: yet yagton is encouraging it
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: nile red it all the way
[7305]: fp needs to do something
[7305]: now
[2921]: that’s a slippery slope
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: funny joke
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: fp doing something
[7305]: haha yeah
[7305]: this is serious
[2921]: even if I agreed it were moral, it would be extremely dangerous
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: this is iron lung
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: markipilr
[2921]: You can’t have a bunch of untrained kids doing chemistry on their own bodies
[2921]: I don’t care if it’s alcohol, drugs, antidepressants, or HRT
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > he literally sent scantily clad pictures of himself to kids on the discord
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: there's proof that the picture is her but not that she sent it on the discord; and the original accusation is that she sent it on sleepycat
[7305]: that's not all he sent to kids
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: which is also unverifiable
[2921]: I will never support DIY HRT or DIY anything
[7305]: so why are you saying it
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: the fact that the image even exists and there is an accusation is enough for your confirmation biases to activate
[7305]: so you're going to try to blame this on a site that doesn't exist anymore
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: i hope there becomes more diy hrt in 2026
[2921]: I don’t like yagton but I don’t think they are a child predator
[7305]: when yagton literally sent it on the fucking discord
[*1760] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: i hope they make the hrt that turns you into a weird bug
[7305]: in front of everyone's eyes
[7305]: and you're still defending him
[2921]: Maybe they did unwise things with their platform
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: sob
[6307]: Cath just shut the fuck up right now, you’re making normal trans people look bad.
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: risky
[7305]: look normal trans people are fine to me
[7305]: yagton is not fine
[7305]: yagton is sending inappropriate pictures to children
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i hope society becomes accepting enough that that sort of hrt can be produced safely
[*8491] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and tested safely
[7305]: this dude is a fucking admin
[6307]: I agree with lime, if HRT helps children with gender dysphoria in an appropriately controlled study. I want to see it, arranged to be prescribed by a doctor.
[7305]: if he wanted
[7305]: he could sent it and then delete it
[6307]: But kids should not be making their own drugs
[7305]: and then fp would be like duhhhhhhhh wuhhhhhhhh
[7305]: i dun see anyting
[6307]: Cath has such a severe obsession with the “alt right” that they are willing to compromise common sense and their own morals if they think it will offend a conservative
[6307]: Lime, you have got to stand against this eventually
[7305]: like he is now
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > that's not all he sent to kids
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: what the meow
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: there's only teens on the discord
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: whats your proof she sent it to kids
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: =p=
[*1010] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: i lowkirkenuinely hope weird bug hrt becomes a thing 🙏🙏🙏
[6307]: Cath does it give you satisfaction to yap about stuff? No one is paying attention to
[*1010] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: you say, responding to my message
[6307]: Or do you just think I’m so disgusting that you want to elicit some kind of reaction from me to make yourself feel better?
[*1010] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: =8>
[6307]: That’s exactly it, you have such a low self-esteem that you feel the need to get a reaction from me so you can convince yourself that you’re morally superior
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > does it give you satisfaction
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yes, that exactly, and i think that's kinda not cool and makes a bad name for them
[6307]: Yes, it gives them satisfaction to humiliate the right and conservatives while claiming to have empathy
[6307]: Once again, I agree with you lime
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > humiliate
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: you should also not assume intent
[6307]: It’s impossible to proceed in society without making some assumptions of intent
[1522]: i mean i dont go on the discord
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: cvi is likely just doing it to make people like you disappointed because your view of them doesn't matter to them
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > It’s impossible to proceed in society without making some assumptions of intent
[1522]: but the fact he has done this shit before as evidenced on /owotd
[1522]: plus the pics
[1522]: i mean
[1522]: come on
[6307]: I agree with you again, and that’s why conservatives are successful
[*6873] 🐉Dupy🧣: OWOT Candy Cane v2.2 has reached beta stage on build 18!
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: it makes it harder to proceed in society assuming intent
[8436]: You fucking nigger.
[8436]: You fucking nigger.
[*1010] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: i dont think ive ever been on owotd
[6307]: Leftist have become convinced that they have no responsibility to anyone else
[6193]: Owots so dead without me
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: "you're trolling!" is an accusation i assume you get a lot
[6193]: Dead
[1522]: you should go on owotd catha
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -motd
[*6366] Prophetbot: Be careful using bright green on canvas! It's hard to read.
[6307]: Me, or cath?
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and it is understandable because you generalise leftists into what your experience is
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Ugh
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: you
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: 6307
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): .not cool
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): I regret motd
[6307]: All individuals do that
[1522]: catha
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -howdumb motd
[*6366] Prophetbot: [motd Is 76.08712% dumb!]
[1522]: but yeah
[1522]: go there
[*8058] Catha'Vi: im on disc now
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -howdumb -motd
[6193]: My sisters such a anime freak
[*8058] Catha'Vi: wow its a bunch of text
[*8058] Catha'Vi: shocking
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: at least they will let it down when someone proves to be evidently different
[*6873] 🐉Dupy🧣: -mod setmotd QOTD: When you make OWOT userscripts, is your code in one or multiple files? If multiple, what module bundler do you use? (me: multiple, using Parcel)

[6193]: Stfu
[6307]: you’re assuming that people are going to be perfect logical actors when that’s simply not the way the world works
[1522]: mhz doesnt often speak up and really i'm breaking the rules by doing this
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and they will apply it to different levels - i can assume your experiences of trans people were negative, but i can't know for sure, and i don't apply that to your argument
[1522]: but yagton needs to be dealt with
[8711]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXWT9dqSL4
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > you’re assuming that people are going to be perfect logical actors when that’s simply not the way the world works
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i would like you to get closer to that, though
[6307]: My experience with trans people is mixed
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: that's why i'm saying you shouldn't generalise
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Hi
[*9373] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Anyonw chat?
[6193]: Guys my little sisters obsessed with anime n its scaring me like ok it was cool at first but its becoming her whole life
[*6873] 🐉Dupy🧣: there are 21 files in Candy Cane's /src folder btw
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: [apply that to your argument] -> [apply that to my arguments] oops
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: that's why i'm saying you shouldn't generalise nor assume intent*
[6307]: And I’m not generalizing trans people or leftists, I’m generalizing cath’s behavior as part of a pattern of counterproductive and selfish reasoning
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: which you usually cannot confirm
[*8058] Catha'Vi: what even is ts about
[6307]: Block all the anime sites from the router level
[*8058] Catha'Vi: lowkirkenuine question
[6307]: I’m not helping you, Kath
[6193]: How tf do i do that
[6193]: ALSO
[6307]: You’re gonna need to figure it out yourself using your own brain
[6193]: NO
[6193]: bc i watch it sometimes aswell
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: The last major (non-bugfix) update to OWOT was nearly a year ago (action links). Just look at any of the changelogs, Wiki or world.
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: you post bug stuff to make these anons disappointed and 6307 thinks it's because you wanna mock them ig
[*8058] Catha'Vi: i post bug stuff bc bugs are cool
[7150]: ✅
[*8058] Catha'Vi: idc about the anons either way
[7150]: Im a cool anon
[7150]: RIGHT CATHA
[7150]: RIGHT
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well there it is then lol
[6307]: you’ve probably spoken to me about 50 times so you probably should care
[7150]: Ye i agree
[7150]: Girly
[7150]: Poo
[7150]: Pop
[7150]: Heh
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: no, cvi is saying they weren't posting it because they thought you would react
[6307]: Fair enough
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: don't get into semantics. a rule i apply a lot is "that isn't the best wording but i know what you mean"
[*8058] Catha'Vi: lime, you're making the mistake of gaf about the anons
[7150]: Catha
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: intentionally misinterpreting things is kinda bad i think
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: makes things more of an argument, rather than a discussion
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: bad-faith debating for short
[7150]: Lime dont litsen to catha he a hater
[*4512] Dat_Hack3r: fp is no longer actively creating value, and his power largely derives from the dying momentum of this website.
[6307]: Well, I originally came here to antagonize Cath
[*1] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): `O`
[6307]: I perceive them to be out of touch and resentful toward anyone not in their circle
[*1] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -_-
[7150]: Dat poo hacker
[*1] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Me: *shocked*
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: they a hater[citation needed]*

[4414]: Why do people with brainrot randomly say '67'? Brainrot makes people lose track of the year. So, for people with brainrot, the current year might feel like 1967. That's why they randomly say '67'.

[6307]: yes, and unfortunately, 90% of people just don’t think like that, and will either take advantage of your Goodwill or waste your time
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: sometimes, the other side thinks it's a matter of aggression when i confront them, and they treat it like an argument
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Great
[*2062] giMMICKceLlAR: one file
[4414]: Why do people with brainrot randomly say '67'?  Brainrot makes people lose track of the year. So, for people with brainrot, the current year might feel like 1967. That's why they randomly say '67'.

[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): And i have delay with my messages
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: indeed, many (90% is a crazy overestimate) people assume many things. i want you to be not like that.
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > this is why i ask a lot of questions. "what do you mean by.." "what is your intent.." "what is your point.."
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): And i would want people not op assume

[9066]: no smoke without fire
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: from this, i communicate that i am treating this like a discussion, not an argument. it helps to put focus on what's actually being discussed
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): ChatGPT kills me with assumptions
[6307]: What do you do whenever people are not willing to have a discussion with you?
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): I hate that
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: move on
[9066]: >Dat_Hack3r: fp is no longer actively creating value, and his power largely derives from the dying momentum of this website.
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: something i've struggled to do
[9066]: truer words have never been said before
[6307]: That is respectable
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): I discuss with ChatGPT instead of the unwilling people
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): 🤣 lol
[6307]: Don’t talk about ChatGPT, people are going to accuse you of destroying the environment or stealing from real artists
[9066]: and now
[*4388] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: przypuszczać. przy pu szczać. Przy Pu szczać. czemu sikają na Pu
[9066]: fp is defending pedophiles
[9066]: just like trump
[*2979] e_g.: !whois 1
[*222] funny bot: (4414): Why do people wi...
[*2979] e_g.: okay makes sense
[*2979] e_g.: wokrs
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): I use it as a chat website to chat with an overassuming bot
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: there is no proof of where fern sent it
[*2979] e_g.: what was i gonna do again
[6307]: I like using AI, but a lot of others do not
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: only an accusation of "sleepycat!" points to it
[*5023] fp: this is already being investigated based on all evidence that I've collected from this chat
[9066]: he sent it on the discord you idiot
[9066]: everyone knows this
[9066]: they saw it
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): I like wi too
[6307]: I don’t think the accusation is real
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): *ai
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Not wi
[9066]: hes a fucking admin
[*5023] fp: the complication is that the story keeps changing every time
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: the original link had a channel ID that matched none of the channel IDs in the Discord
[9066]: he deleted it
[9066]: of course he deleted it himself
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): What story?
[6307]: Be careful, some people will bully you for liking AI
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Ok i am
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Thx, anon 6307
[9066]: ok fp how does the story keep changing
[9066]: we literally gave you the evidence
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: bullying someone for using AI is ultimately a form of discrimination and i don't like how many people don't realise that
[*2979] e_g.: nvm i remembered
[*5023] fp: user "owot files" on January 3: "It's hard to prove anything"
[*5023] fp: user "owot files" on January 3: "online"
[*5023] fp: user "owot files" on January 3: "especially since sleepycat is down now"
[9066]: jan 3rd is long before any of this came out that was just a troll
[9066]: ignore it
[*7799] TR58: tung
[*7799] TR58: hi e-g
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: you can educate them, tell them this and that about the AI they're using, and the electricity bills;
[*7799] TR58: 7799
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: but if you keep pestering them because of what they use, that's not very nice
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -whois
[*6366] Prophetbot: ["7799" Was Sent By "TR58" (7799)!]
[*5023] fp: that's not helping the case because those images were sent on January 3rd as well
[*5023] fp: albeit with far less info I can work with
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -whois 7
[*6366] Prophetbot: ["what was…" Was Sent By "e_g." (2979)!]
[9066]: wait
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Great
[9066]: what
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): -whois
[*6366] Prophetbot: ["Great" Was Sent By "NourRamy" (7113)!]
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): No fakes
[*5023] fp: the Discord links he sent pointed to a channel that did not exist on our Discord server
[9066]: so if the images were actually sent why are you still keeping that guy around
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: they were not sent on the discord as fp just said
[9355]: alright
[9066]: >fp does nothing again
[9066]: welp see you back on /mhz
[9066]: jk ill stick arond for a bit
[4490]: sybau
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: 9066, are you actually listening, or just holding on to the accusation
[9066]: as a denizen of whatever
[*5023] fp: this doesn't prove fernsy sent those images, just that somebody has possession of those images
[9066]: dude
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: that too
[9066]: fp
[9066]: if it was literally anyone else
[9066]: if it was pinkiepie
[9066]: you would have immediately thrown them under the bus
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: 9066, are you just holding on to the accusation or what?
[9066]: why are you defending this guy
[9066]: i'm losing faith in you fp
[*2979] e_g.: i have a theory that all anons are blind to the truth as soon as they're wrong
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: defending this guy :dislike: criticising factual inaccuracy in an accusation :like:
[3273]: -howtransgender Prophetbot
[*6366] Prophetbot: [Prophetbot Is 30.31852% transgender!]
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: pfff
[*5023] fp: accusation #1: those images depict fern; accusation #2: fern sent those images in a chatroom full of minors
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well this one certainly is
[*5023] fp: we can work together to prove or disprove this
[9066]: yeah but look
[9066]: you wouldnt even have numbered the accusations
[9066]: if it was literally anyone else
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: metadata supports #1. #2 can't be proven.
[9066]: come on fp
[*5023] fp: why would I have jumped to ban anyone else without any evidence?
[*8058] Catha'Vi: metadata is very easy to fake, especially given examples from other photos sent by fern
[*2979] e_g.: wait fr though where does the image even come from 💀
[*5023] fp: I would press for evidence if this was any other person
[9066]: you ban people with no evidence all the time
[5310]: 67!!!!
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: 9066, stop criticising that it's happening; your accusation is being scrutinised, you need to consider this.
[*5023] fp: who did I ban without evidence?
[9066]: dude
[9066]: you need to get this dude as far away from you as possible
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: it is happening and you can't do anything
[6732]: Why do people with brainrot randomly say '67'?  Brainrot makes people lose track of the year. So, for people with brainrot, the current year might feel like 1967. That's why they randomly say '67'.
[9066]: it doesnt even matter really if he's guiilty or innocent
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i'm convinced you're just holding on to the accusation at this point
[6732]: so 5310 is currently in year 1967
[9066]: people are going to start noticing
[*5023] fp: I am still actively investigating this in spite of the lack of evidence I currently have
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: noticing what
[9066]: ok so what would you need theoretically
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: evidence that it's been put in a room full of minors
[*5023] fp: to get a straight story
[9066]: because we already gave you everything
[9066]: we gave you the images he sent on discord
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: no you didn't, because the channel id is not in our server
[9355]: 9066: concrete evidence would be nice?
[9066]: they have the metadata
[9066]: we didnt fuck with them
[*5023] fp: those images have EXIF data, Discord strips those out
[*5023] fp: so they were sent somewhere else
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ^
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: we only got the exif data from the catbox reposts
[9066]: yeah unless he sent them on another vector
[9066]: like catbox
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: okay
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: so we don't know where she sent them
[9066]: which he would
[*8173] 🝦 kipisi Lime: great thanks
[9066]: if he was trying to cover his tracks
[9066]: let me ask you this
[9066]: why do we even have these images
[9066]: because he sent them right
[*5023] fp: that's what my question is too
[9066]: i'm only a 2nd hand source here
[9066]: but like where else would they have came from
[*7224] ⁧: >literally 1967
[*7224] ⁧: -6
[*6366] Prophetbot: [SEVENNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!]
[9066]: its clearly him
[9066]: he spends all his time on the discord
[*5023] fp: that's why we need to figure out how that image got in the hands of the person who sent those here
[9355]: was anything illegal in the images? if not, we can stop wasting our time
[9066]: depends on your interpretation
[9355]: so, that's a no?
[9066]: there was no penis but it was clearly sexualized
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: the accusation is that the image was sent to a chatroom of minors, which is unprovable with current evidence
[9066]: keep in mind
[9066]: there doesnt have to be nudity for an image to be sexualized
[*5023] fp: if it turns out that the image was indeed shared in a chatroom full of minors, then that's a serious offense and would be the end of it.
[*3065] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Come to https://ourworldoftext.com/dont_visit_this_site___.com
[9355]: half the internet is sexualized. maybe make the discord 18+ if there's a fear
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: keep in mind: the channel id of the original discord link is nowhere in our server
[9066]: why take the risk
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: take what risk?
[*5023] fp: because framing people happens all day, every day
[*3065] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): Basically come to /dont_visit_this_site___.com
[*5023] fp: there's definitely a motive for framing a trans person
[*5023] fp: what I'm trying to prove or disprove is if this is a framing attempt
[9066]: oh so cause he's trans he gets a free pass?
[9066]: typical
[9355]: and there we are
[*5023] fp: you're not arguing in good faith
[9066]: i am
[*8058] Catha'Vi: >(OP) fp: there's definitely a motive for framing a trans person
and especially a motive for an owot anon framing fern
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > oh so cause he's trans he gets a free pass?
[*5023] fp: framing is a plausible scenario
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: no
[9066]: i told you i'm from mhz
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: fp did not say this
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): kipisi Lime came and told me Huh?
[*7113] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): I dont get it
[9066]: they sent me here to figure out what the fuck is going on with this guy and that;'s the only reason i'm here
[9066]: and we dont really like you people
[9066]: i mean you know that
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well what we've figured out is: metadata points to the images being fern, but it could be tampered; we don't know where it was sent, other than discord and NOT in our server; we don't know who sent the images
[9066]: its so easy to send images out of band
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: out of band..?
[9066]: do you really think a smart guy like that is sitting like like duhhhhh buhhhhhhhh
[9066]: guess ill sent it on discord
[9066]: no
[9066]: anyways
[9066]: look
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: okay
[9066]: i was here to provide evidence
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: where is your evidence
[6422]: did fern address the shits yet
[9066]: i already sent it and it doesnt matter to you and fp already has it
[*5023] fp: you're a second hand source, your evidence is just going to poison the investigation
[9355]: The plot goes deep. Good to know that upstanding citizens from mhz are on the case, no?
[9066]: i'll go then
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: miao
[9066]: good luck with the investigation fp
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: fern said: eh just some random ass troll trying to fabricate a story to get rid of me
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > ik it's baseless so idc :loaf:
[*5023] fp: what I need is exactly the person who initially sent those catbox links this morning
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > the only one doing such a thing is ironically the person posting those photos
[*4700] Dat_Hack3r: On OWOT, there exists a privileged elite whose power is derived less from personal merit than structural position. This elite occupies a figurative "island", largely detached from the wider OWOT community, yet disproportionately visible and influential to the site's ruling class.
[*5023] fp: that person has all the answers
[*4700] Dat_Hack3r: All aspects of this dynamic are problematic. Within the elite, a form of self-regulation is carried out to ensure that all members conform to the existing ideology. The ruling class, on the other hand, is stagnant. Having implemented little constructive change in nearly a year, their power largely derives from the dying momentum of this site.
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: fern denied that she was the one in the photo
[*4700] Dat_Hack3r: A powerful clique is thus formed, its members engaging in form of regulatory capture, advocating for increasingly tight restrictions on the freedom of the many in order to serve the special interests of the few. This phenomenon is apparent without the need for excessive elaboration.
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > metadata points to the images being fern, but it could be tampered
[9355]: K
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: by the way, the image was seen on january 3rd, but the date taken was january 30th
[9355]: THX
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: this is spoofing most likely
[5864]: ferns island
[5864]: release them andrei files'
[9355]: How does metadata point to a specific person? Was there comparable material?
[*2602] CarlBatman: call me a carousel seat the way im bouncin up and down
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: fern owns the same phone model in the metadata
[9355]: Might narrow the search, but that sounds far from conclusive
[9355]: Unless it's some rare model?
[*1987] TR58: ffs
[*1987] TR58: internet
[*2821] CarlBatman: six seven!
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: everything here is far from conclusive. there may simply not have enough evidence at all to declare fern (not) guilty.
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and there's a reason justice systems work in innocent until proven guilty
[*2550] 🝦 kipisi Lime: :zzz:
[9355]: Sounds like a wild goose chase, and people are muddying the waters the longer it takes

[*553] rscr: arna?
[*5023] fp: arna left our server about a week ago and doesn't appear to be associated with us anymore
[9416]: we need a final solution to the fern question
[*553] rscr: wasn't that screenshot really suspicious
[9416]: how so
[9416]: wait first i should ask
[9416]: which screenshot
[*553] rscr: a while ago somebody sent a screenshot of a supposed pedo friend of fern's
[*553] rscr: whose username was censored, but with enough left out (on purpose) to show that it ended with "na"
[9416]: ah
[6402]: kekekeke

This phenomenon is apparent without the need for excessive elaboration.
[*6047] Dat_Hack3r: This power imbalance is sustained by two factors: the perceived lack of leverage among ordinary users, as well as the overrepresentation of this exclusive elite in the eyes of the ruling class. A tool must exist to offset this power imbalance by giving the disadvantaged majority access to a real means of change, following the principles of open source.

[9622]: i just dont understand
[*5023] fp: if the legal system ran the way you think it should, then rape accusations would immediately send victims to prison
[*5023] fp: the whole point is to prove those accusations are true, which I am working on
[*5023] fp: the initial report mentions sleepycat, but today's report mentions Discord. the story isn't straight so I need to work on figuring out what really happened.
[*5023] fp: all I'm saying is that if info is withheld or inconsistent, then I need to find out why that's the case
[*5023] fp: somebody mentioned an imageboard thread of some sort on this, why was I not sent that?
[*5023] fp: this allegedly happened in early 2025, why wasn't I told back then?
[*5023] fp: the attachment from January shows the image being uploaded last October to a Discord server not affiliated with us or any server I'm part of

[*6047] Dat_Hack3r: 9622

[6218]: Juno, what is your least favorite troonslop
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: Well troonslop refers to anything that is made by troons and is low budget, so.
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: It would probably be stuff like:
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: MLP, The Amazing Digital Circus, Danganronpa, Doki Doki
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: And the list goes on
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: Fundamental Paper Education, from what I've heard, is really bad troonslop.
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: Boykisser is one of my least favorite troonslops.
[6218]: What about Boykisser, Baba is You, OneShot, Celeste, and Ultrakill
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: Mainly because of Shitssu
[6218]: i hate fpe
[6218]: i hate schessju too
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: Baba is You, OneShot, Celeste, and Ultrakill are horribly bad troonslop.
[6218]: what is your favorite chuddy thing then

[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: White power
[*2801] JunoTehPlanet: And Russian irridentism

[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: okay I understand, but...
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: There are only a small minority of Mexicans who ACTUALLY come from white settlers.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: Basically I read the whole article and everything that is said in here is truthful and correct:
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: https://soyjakwiki.org/Mexico
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: A majority of Mexicans come from the indigenous savages.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: And Mexicans themselves aren't even a single race.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: They came from various background lineages
[*4948] rscr: it's all written in spanish :sob:
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: First there are the indigenous savages.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: And then there are the white settlers
[*4948] rscr: for what it's worth i do appreciate the soyjak wiki's sense of humor
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: But the genetic profiles of Mexicans vary
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: Some are more white in the genetic sense
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: and some are more indigenous
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: At best, only some are considered impure whites.
[*4948] rscr: they put a lot of effort and creativity into writing the nastiest insults about everythign imaginable
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: And most of the more white-like Mexicans are concentrated in the northern regions.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: And the more indigenous ones are concentated in the southern regions.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: So there is a big regional divide.

[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: Fun fact: Windows Vista is actually Windows 6
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: And Windows 2000 is actually Windows 5
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: There is evidence in their kernel types
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: And Windows XP is Windows 5.1
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: However, Windows 2000, XP, and Vista are all NT based.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: Meaning that they were originally for business purposes
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: While the 9x series was for personal purposes.
[*5711] JunoTehPlanet: Both of which became fused once the release of XP was done.

[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Who's squinch?

[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: NO NOT THE POLKENPANTS AGAIN!!!!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Schjessu is a subhuman
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: From my own eyes.

[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Like, way beyond subhuman.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: He's been groomed by the (((troonslop)))
[9056]: we don’t know if he’s ugly, and there’s nothing wrong with being gay, trans, or a furry
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: It puts you at trouble with God.
[9056]: I’m personally an atheist
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: And being a subhuman also puts you at trouble with God.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: since subhumans cannot go to Agartha.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I mean, not Agartha
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I mean, HEAVEN?
[4807]: Just got a 97.2% perfect circle!
[9056]: God didn’t create subhumans, God created all people in his image
[*9764] Squinch: It is foolish to assume anything about what the supreme being of the universe thinks or wants.
[4807]: Just got a 97.2% perfect circle!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: And who do I consider "subhumans" from my own eyes?
[4807]: OMG!!!!!!! JUST GOT A LEGENDARY 98.5% PERFECT CIRCLE!!!!!!! (NEW PB!)
[*4018] 𘶀𐥑𲎰𖺻𜻰𑷏꧌♅𝅙␛𖼝𝼐ᴞ꧍⁧: 91% circle
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I consider groups like negroes, faggots, troons, and other LGBT people, Jews, communists, Jehovah's Witnessess believers, gooners, and drug addicts, as subhumans.
[9056]: So you’re OK with Muslims?
[4807]: Just got a 97.7% perfect circle!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: The racially inferior but not subhuman I consider are groups like Asians, Latinos, Arabs, Indigenous Americans, Indigenous Siberians, and Turks
[4807]: Bro!!! JUST GOT A STUPID 0.3% PERFECT CIRCLE!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Muslims are inferior and disappoiating
[9056]: What about South Asian/Indians?
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I consider all European and white people (regardless of whether fully or partially), as superior
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Indians are racially inferior in my opinion.
[9056]: What about Southeast Asians, like Thai, Vietnamese, or Khmer?
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Also inferior
[9056]: Do you consider yourself to be Latino?
[4807]: Bro! Just got a 0.6% perfect circle! 😂😂😂
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: No, not really
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Latinos on average are part white part indigenous.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Unfortunately, I am considered impure in my ideology because I have some Native American ancestral traits.
[4426]: i mean it's no big surprise all the pedo admins here defend eachother
[4807]: Bro! Just got a 0.8% perfect circle! 😂😂😂
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: But I'm still considered white enough to be part of the "race".
[9056]: How do you feel about native West Africans, like Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba?
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: subhumans.
[9056]: They can’t all be that way, Africa is by far the most diverse continent
[4807]: Just got a 97.1% perfect circle!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: And for me though
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: My ancestry clearly influences my appearance.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: As I am pale-skinned
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I have brown hair and brown eyes.
[4807]: Just got a 97.4% perfect circle!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: And I'm actually so pale that the Sun will burn me.
[9056]: OK, what about the Oromo?
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: So I do not tan very easily.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: subhumans
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Instead, I burn
[9056]: what is wrong with the Oromo?
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: They are considered too African
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I'm talking, the native Africans
[*9791] Schjessu: back
[4807]: Just got a 97.3% perfect circle!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Which include people like, Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, Cushitic, Pygmy, and Khoisan
[9056]: There are actually some countries in Africa that are among the most racially homogenous
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: and Chadic too.
[4807]: Just got a 97.1% perfect circle!
[9056]: For example: 99.7% of Lesotho all belong to the same ethnic group
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: My skin is actually so pale, that it never really tans.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Instead, it burns.
[4807]: Just got a 97.0% perfect circle!
[9056]: That’s more than any “white“ country
[*4018] 𘶀𐥑𲎰𖺻𜻰𑷏꧌♅𝅙␛𖼝𝼐ᴞ꧍⁧: palest skin
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: There is no way I would be a "subhuman
[9056]: If you support racial purity, you should look to Africa and not Europe
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: in terms of Schjessu's own eyes.
[9056]: People in Africa also support family, hard work, and traditional values
[9056]: These are all conservative values that right wingers would otherwise support
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: But because I'm contaminated with some Native American ancestral traits.
[*5534] Schjessu: juno post chatlogs
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Which is why Schjessu calls me a Meximutt
[4807]: Just got a 97.0% perfect circle!
[4807]: Just got a 97.0% perfect circle!
[9056]: They don’t actually think you’re a subhuman, they just don’t like you being racist
[9056]: Actually, they believe all races are equal, including Mexican
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I know, they just don't like me.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Because of my propaganda.
[7675]: so go away
[9056]: They don’t like you because you insert controversial statements about race in every conversation when it doesn’t need to be.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: And all these people are calling me "polkenpants" in response.
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I find it insulting
[9056]: That’s such a silly word, I can’t believe that you would get offended over it
[4807]: Just got a 97.6% perfect circle!
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I imagine someone who is polkenpants
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: As someone who looks a lot like Willy Wonka?
[9056]: There’s nothing wrong with people who look like that
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: You know Willy Wonka?

[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: I like propaganda.
[*5534] Schjessu: not a single soul likes you
[7675]: because you're a racist, you dips hit polkenpants
[9056]: He could potentially be a good user if he stopped all racist things
[7675]: *dipshit
[*1021] JunoTehPlanet: Ugh fine, I'll go.

[*2191] Catzcute4: fun fact: if you have superfluid helium and rotate the container too slowly, the fluid just won’t really move at all, because it can only spin in integer quanta (basically, it could not spin, or spin a bit, but not spin between a bit or no spin, or spin twice a bit but then seperate into two vorticies)
[*3654] Holy-Terrorist: ^³^

[*2670] CarlBatman: "B-b-but im supporting CBAT IRONICALLY!"
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: so the moon is heaven squared
[*2670] CarlBatman: "its just ironic!'

[*4014] Europe2048: also the sky surrounds earth from all sides, how is heaven not below the earth also?
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: because it's further from the core
[*2670] CarlBatman: 7878 is bonzi
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: so it is above
[*2670] CarlBatman: "what did cbat even tungdo"
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > so all the other planets and moons are above earth? that can't be right
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: it is
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: apparently
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i haven't gotten a definitive answer of where
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hell or heaven is
[*2670] CarlBatman: cbat harasses literally everyone
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: maybe different realms
[*2670] CarlBatman: sexually too
[7878]: why do you harass bonzicuck then
[*2670] CarlBatman: he started first ;-;
[7878]: how
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: "he started it" isn't sufficient justification
[*8807] Catzcute4: hi
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: two wrongs dont make a right
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: so..
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: tired
[*2670] CarlBatman: i dont remember exactly but he was being super rude to me and when i trolled him a little he sperged out
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hi catz cute sei4
[*8807] Catzcute4: ok hmm, so maybe we measure higher as in 1. take samples of the gravitational field at infinitesimalky moves points (simultaneous in a point’s reference fraim, around that point), 2. extrapolate the center, and 3. use distance from that as height
[*4594] bonzicuck: because
[*4594] bonzicuck: uhhhhhhhh
[*4594] bonzicuck: you make pedophilic """jokes"""
[*2670] CarlBatman: yes they are jokes
[*4594] bonzicuck: and you impersonate other people because they made your clitty leak
[*2670] CarlBatman: im doing this all for attention who couldve guessed
[*8807] Catzcute4: so hell would be inside earth (or maybe higher given that venus exists) annd heaven would have to be higher than everything but heaven, since we’d have seen it clearly otherwise, everything else is in between or lower than both
[*4594] bonzicuck: you told me to look at your big meaty cock
[*4594] bonzicuck: (i'm a minor btw)
[*8807] Catzcute4: ok bye
[*8807] Catzcute4: oh wait
[*8807] Catzcute4: wait WHO WOULD SAY THAT
[*8807] Catzcute4: HOW DARE CBAT BE SO POPULAR
[*4594] bonzicuck: that's a blatantly pedophilic joke
[*2670] CarlBatman: bonzi acting like his number one idol isn't worse
[*8807] Catzcute4: cbat, you have no worth in this 93 billion lightyear universe
[*4594] bonzicuck: anon cbat is fake cbat btw
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: maybe heaven is in a 4th dimension
[*4594] bonzicuck: the real cbat is bold and blue
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: spatial
[*4594] bonzicuck: and is not an anon
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: dimension
[*8807] Catzcute4: makes sense
[*8807] Catzcute4: (to both users)
[*3202] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and if we go ana/kata we go into heaven/hell respectively
[*8807] Catzcute4: yeah i guess makes some sense
[*9827] bonzicuck: the anon cbat is an alt of retstu
[*9827] bonzicuck: i think
[*2670] CarlBatman: be so fr
[*8807] Catzcute4: when it comes to soul’ I think the SCP wiki’s fictional explanation as “fractal patterns in thaumodynamic fields” makes the most sense
[1968]: We need sex back
[*8807] Catzcute4: since in cannon they are formed for exolutionary reasons
[1968]: Our sex is missing
[*8807] Catzcute4: *evolutionary
[*2670] CarlBatman: why does bonzi keep calling me retstu
[*8807] Catzcute4: so maybe those fields would interact along other dimensions beside the 3+1 of minkowski

[*1628] JunoTehPlanet: I actively encourage straight, heterosexual, cisgender, supremacy.
[*8692] Schjessu: but why :thinq:
[*1628] JunoTehPlanet: straight supremacy is good.
[*8692] Schjessu: but why :thinq:
[*1628] JunoTehPlanet: Because that's how we are naturally designed.

[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Faggots are gross, unhealthy, and mentally ill.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Faggots are notorious for their nightclub culture, but God was a homophobe and mindbroke them by making STDs. Faggots love all kinds of degenerate and unnatural sexual acts, which causes various issues like anal prolapse, incontinence and high rates of diseases such as syphilis, monkeypox, and AIDS.

[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: And click "Clear all public areas"
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: That is the easiest solution.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Christianity, like Islam and Judaism, tells the story of when God once dropped two faggot-incinerating TRVTHNVKES on two towns called Sodom and Gomorrah because of their faggotry.🗝️ The term "Sodomy", is derived from this story. Faggot Christians seethe over this fact and claim that he destroyed the cities because they were full of rapists or something. During the 1960's, Christian acceptance of
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: During the 1960's, Christian acceptance of faggots started to go up, which marked a split between the liberals and the Christians who actually read the Bible, as the Bible has verses condemning homosexuality
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Muslims are notably homophobic,🗝️ because it's haram to be a faggot according to the Quran[8][9][10][11] and Sunnah[12] where the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah are also narrated. In recent times, the normalization of sodomy and transgenderism amongst Muslim societies has been an utter failure. Islamist regimes like the Taliban crack down on Jartycuck-tier cultural practices like Bacha Bazi, where
[*3906] Holy-Terrorist: 🗝️
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Islamist regimes like the Taliban crack down on Jartycuck-tier cultural practices like Bacha Bazi, where underage boys are molested, with extreme punishments. This information proves once and for all that ISLAM WON, KEEP TAKING LLLLLLZZZZZ AND KEEP RAGING ON ME!!!!

[*4745] JunoTehPlanet: Actually, that is not me.
[*4745] JunoTehPlanet: Someone hacked my account.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Actually, the article is lying in that section
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Islam lost actually
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: It didn't win
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Since it's subordinate.
[*8692] Schjessu: yeah its lying that one time you dislike what it says huh
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: >Most major faggot rights activists in the late 20th century were pedophiles or supported NAMBLA. This is because many of them didn’t just wanna stop at normalizing faggotry, they wanted to normalize many taboos accross western society. Infact, fag activists only started disassociating with NAMBLA after the UN told them to stop flying pedo banners so fucking much. Faggots often get very leaky when
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: >Faggots often get very leaky when you remind them that most fags, historically, were pedophiles.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: You see the pedophiliac connections of faggotry?
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Most faggots are pedos
[*4745] JunoTehPlanet: Grrr... You will not see the last of me!
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Therefore, this proves that they are subhumans.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: They don't care about the kids.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Or their safety
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: They care about grooming.
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: Gays always groom all the time
[*8638] JunoTehPlanet: To force people to act their ways.

[*4231] kkb: just checked you owot page, nice big cat :) and i like those colored tile patterns
[*4231] kkb: your*
[*1455] yosicat: wow that means a lot, i was one of the 2020's generation of artists on ywot that was inspired by your works
[*4231] kkb: also on ywot, i didn't know ywot had colors now? been a long time since i visited there
[*1455] yosicat: idk about that, but its possible with some emoji magic
[*1455] yosicat: anyways, i've invited you to a secret art world with rscr
[5421]: ywot doesn't have colors
[*4231] kkb: thanks that is a nice compliment, i'm not as active as i sometimes like to be
[5617]: *Cuts off your balls cutely*
[*4231] kkb: oh i don't usually become members of other worlds (mainly because i'm not active for prolonged periods)
[*4231] kkb: 5421 but yosicat's world is all pink? maybe you can choose text colors like on owot
[*4231] kkb: i don't really remember, i was always a black/white person :)
[*6695] america: hi i remember you
[5421]: yeah if people own worlds on ywot they can change the colors
[5421]: but the main world and non-owned worlds are b&w
[5421]: (other than links for urls and coordinates, of course)
[*6695] america: i only went on ywot like 2 times
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: i remember ywot in 2023
[*4231] kkb: yosicat there's some really nice artwork on that world
[*6695] america: i do t remember yosicat though
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: i panned a ton with my mouse to get to a place where chenn labs were doing stuff with the void
[*6695] america: is that like the ywot equivalent of alt labs
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: pretty much
[*6695] america: which i dont know much about either
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: they have stickmen with the 0 character as their heads
[*1455] yosicat: oh yeah you don't have to do anything btw that's just where we save an dump art
[*6695] america: like ruby from /main
[*6695] america: (i think)
[*1455] yosicat: it was originally inspired by a world from ywot's ycentral many moons ago
[*1455] yosicat: but it's nice to have an og be a member there
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yourworldoftext.wiki/*
[*4231] kkb: still scrolling around, some amazing stuff there; i guess i miss a lot because i usually get on owot a couple days in a row, then leave for several months :D
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: search thing for the ywot wiki

[*4410] america: uh
[*4410] america: italian painter
[*4410] america: or something
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: leonardo dicaprio???
[*4231] kkb: yosicat: i have a couple of textfiles with saved art from ywot, from worlds that have long been destroyed. i will scroll more and if i don't find it i can create a section to paste it (not my art)
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: the guy who painted the mona lisa?????????
[*5674] america: leonardo de caprio
[*4231] kkb: and thanks for the invite, i will stick around for a while then; i usually leave worlds right away lol :D
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: lol
[*1455] yosicat: yeah that would be awesome, you can dump all the art you want and some other members will draw alongside it
[*1455] yosicat: 1052 you prolly belong there toohold on
[*1455] yosicat: that was dabinky
[*2352] Europe2048: hi
[*1455] yosicat: howdy europe
[*4231] kkb: i will add a note to it, it would be nice if it is saved as it was originally on ywot; maybe an artist recognizes their work because it's all made by unknown people
[*8308] america: leonardo the vinci
[*4231] kkb: it was before the time that account got their ~accountname world on ywot so it's old
[*6353] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: hi all
[*6353] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: still sick
[*1455] yosicat: i've also been meaning to post and recreate teh anonymous art i have there
[*4231] kkb: i love the new analog clock; the bouncing balls are a lot more entertaining than the digital part it had earlier :)
[*1455] yosicat: got a pile from 2022
[*7355] america: well thats to be expected
[*1455] yosicat: oh and we figured out that the old pre~ worlds still existed, it just moved to the user world
[*7355] america: people are usually sick for at least a day
[*1455] yosicat: for example if i was a 2012 user, my old world /yosicat would be /~yosicat/yosicatin
[*7355] america: um
[5421]: what are you sick with
[*4231] kkb: true, but when the ~ worlds arrived, it was unknown who "claimed" (started) the page since accountname was often different than worldname
[*7355] america: i still empathize though
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: aids
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: it's obviously aids
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: he's dying
[*1455] yosicat: yea that'd make it difficult to find the others that didnt match the username
[*7355] america: fever i tgink
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: i send my prayers to jtpl so his aids get cured
[*3023] 💗GoldShip🤍: fever is a symptom
[*5625] the big k: hi what are you guys talking about
[*7355] america: ik
[*7355] america: ol
[*7355] america: ok*
[*6624] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: imagine if you could get wikipedia as one massive book
[*6624] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: and then you read an article only to see it was vandalized
[*5625] the big k: alright mb
[*5625] the big k: ngl thats a pretty funny idea
[*6849] Holy-Terrorist: Wow
[*6849] Holy-Terrorist: > ♥ 999
[*4231] kkb: for example there was a ywot world named /frogs but that probably moved to /~couldbeliterallyanything/frogs  :D
[*5625] the big k: art installation where theres a big book and markers on the side and someone can vandalize the book using them if they want
[*7274] fp: hey guys, on the topic of ~user worlds on ywot, the site displayed the new URL for the world if you visited the root /world page
[*7274] fp: but that only lasted for a short time
[*4231] kkb: just an example, most stuff was destroyed before the ~ worlds were even there
[*485] america: What if you tried to print Wikipedia?
[*6849] Holy-Terrorist: typin_ highscore
[*2834] prohibit: xkcd answered that
[*5625] the big k: shit would take alot of ink and the worlds biggest printer
[5421]: imagine you're looking up Newton's laws of motion or something and it says "maddison s. is in love with komdean and their date is tonight!!!!!!!omg............ everybody at komdean's house butt hole"
[5421]: this is actual wikipedia vandalism from years ago btw
[*1737] america: im referencing the title of the video
[*4231] kkb: thanks fp i forgot that short transitional period
[*5625] the big k: >looks up schizophrenia
[*5625] the big k: >page is blank
[*7274] fp: if you remember the WOTDs from 2010-2013, then the original ~user names appear to be documented on one of infra's worlds
[*7274] fp: -> /~infraraven/wotd
[5421]: you can see every revision of every article going back to the date that article was created
[*139] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: fever
[5421]: except for some really old articles that originated in the earliest days of the site when the storage was unreliable
[*7274] fp: during the deployment of the new ~user scheme, I believe the site also updated every URL link (mostly)
[*4231] kkb: hey i'm there, i even forgot i owned the /u world for a long time, nice
[*1737] america: i like adding 's to multiple word phrases to make possessives
[*1737] america: all of you's
[*1455] yosicat: that's very useful fp, wish i knew that back in the ywot wiki days
[*1455] yosicat: kkb hey i've been there, was it like the utopia world?
[*4231] kkb: i'm going to see if i can claim that again so the url doesn't 404
[*5625] the big k: eats popcorn
[*7274] fp: spacenut's /comprehensive also lists all the original worlds, but curiously doesn't include the ~usernames
[*1737] america: the guy who stole the milk's
[*7274] fp: maybe they directly inputted /worldname and omitted the yourworldoftext.com domain from it, which probably screwed with the porting
[*4231] kkb: yosicat no, at some point i tried to claim a 1 letter world, and /u was available to my surprise. it hosted my ywot art
[*1455] yosicat: >this page is designed for only, we, the few. We who have sharpened our skills and ventured to the end

[*4231] kkb: i didn't really hijack an existing world, because there was mostly some spam on it or random lines, not artworks
[*1455] yosicat: your name was listed there, dated sep 2012
[*1455] yosicat: wonder what that was about
[*1455] yosicat: ~u/OurUtopia

[*4231] kkb: yosicat: ah i see the confusion, i owned /u before the ~ names, i never was username "u" so ~u isn't me :)
[*4231] kkb: sorry that line confused even me
[*4231] kkb: ourutopia was linked at the edge (i believer top edge) of ywot universe
[4219]: i have 2 questions
[*8825] C_G: WHO even is this speeimp licks u gu: :xor_green:
[7058]: :ohelno:
[4219]: 1. kkb did you add carrion to the do not feed the trolls art
[*4231] kkb: so those who could script their way to the very edge (there was no change in hell you could do this by scrolling before running out of memory at even 0.01% on the way) could have bragging rights of reaching it :)
[7058]: :notcool:
[4219]: 2. fp when will you add blue
[*4231] kkb: 4219: i'm not sure what carrion is?
[9149]: I added the carrion
[4219]: carrion is a little monster someone made
[4219]: hes kinda like a staple of owot
[4219]: you can go on the wiki for more info
[*4231] kkb: ah i've seen various added thing to the trolls image, also a snake like figure, and a colored one
[*4231] kkb: i can't add them to my page though, since they're someone else's art
[4219]: oh ok
[4219]: i thought you added it to a version of that art i didnt know it was someone else
[4219]: anyway is fp still here
[*4231] kkb: 4219: lol that is amazing, i have seen that monster once, but i didn't know it had a name or that it was a recurring character, very nice
[*4231] kkb: (checked wiki)
[*7274] fp: still here
[*7274] fp: blue will be here, we just don't know what date or time
[*7274] fp: that's being worked on
[4219]: we? thats new
[4219]: but if you say so
[*4231] kkb: 4219: pretty much all art that took me some effort will be on my page. there are some coop projects that are not there because they couldn't be saved in time before someone griefed it (both from ywot and owot)
[*2352] Europe2048: holy-terrorist, h or g?
[*1043] america: baldwin the owot guy
[*1043] america: (new mascot)
[*1043] america: the h meme is exactly the type of thing id expect you to mention
[*4231] kkb: especially on ywot, copy scripts were a bit more hassle, so when enjoying a drawing with 1 or 2 other people at the same time, it could be gone in an instant before you realized "hey maybe it would be nice if someone saved this" :D
[*7274] fp: I remember utilizing a lot of poopman's scripts starting in 2015 onwards
[7058]: hi fpp
[*7274] fp: one of them was the copy script, which worked decently enough
[7058]: lets kiss each other and make a new baby named blue?
[*5868] texterman: collect my text...
[3114]: >I remember utilizing a lot of poopman's scripts starting in 2015 onwards
[3114]: was poopman young in that day?
[*7274] fp: I don't know
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: how old is poopman again
[5421]: a really boring song popped into my head and i realized it's been ten years since it came out and then i heard it way too often
[5421]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Let_Me_Down_(The_Chainsmokers_song)
[*4231] kkb: fp: i remember scripts from poopman and skf, i wasn't good at tile manipulation/copying, i mostly drew. i did make a teleporter script though, which is why i ended up on ourutopia :)
[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: >[5421]: a really boring song popped into my head and i realized it's been ten years since it came out and then i heard it way too often

[*4325] [GP]Acc-1øƽշ🐱‍💻(꧍♂️🇸🇰: i heard the song too many times and it lost the magic
[*7274] fp: (s)he probably wasn't around when I was
[5421]: well with "don't let me down" i always thought the song was boring but i still had to listen to it
[*4231] kkb: from what i recall, he kept a low profile, but i made some art for him. i'm not even sure if he's on owot
[5331]: > (s)he probably wasn't around when I was [5421]: well with "don't let me down" i always thought the song was boring but i still had to listen to it
[5331]: >(s)he probably wasn't around when I was
[*4231] kkb: fp: just checked if his page is still there https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~skf  it's pretty empty but you can see a mention of his script and how it moved to private; he didnt like spammers abusing his stuff (and very rightly so)
[5331]: what happened to anonguy?
[5421]: has music gotten better in those 10 years?
[5421]: i doubt it
[*1455] yosicat: OH RIGHT KKB
[*1455] yosicat: i've always wanted to ask you about moomin
[*7274] fp: anonguy? he's still around, probably not on ywot though.
[*1455] yosicat: we've made art together, along with rscr anonymous
[5421]: i generally don't listen to current music because the last time i was listening to present-day music it was boring crap like "don't let me down"
[*1455] yosicat: anonymously*
[*7274] fp: I'm more of a 60's or 70's guy
[*4231] kkb: yosicat are you moomin from ywot? i'm confused; i did a small coop with her (i think it was a her?) their art was always cute
[5331]: > anonguy? he's still around, probably not on ywot though.
[5331]: i though he had medical issues/
[*4231] kkb: is moomin on owot?
[*7274] fp: depends on whether we're talking about the same anonguy
[*7274] fp: if it's the one I think it is, he does have some issues but I don't know if he's faking it
[*1455] yosicat: no but we'd always draw and collab together on spawn but never really talked, i was hoping you know more
[*1455] yosicat: but that's all due to ywot's anonimity anyways
[*4231] kkb: to be honest, on ywot i chatted in spawn sometime but i never saved convos and often forgot who i talked to; no offense if i don't remember anyone particular
[*4231] kkb: over here with this chat it's easier to see who's who (sort of) but on ywot you mainly recognized people by their art style and the way they typed
[*1412] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: h
[*4231] kkb: and if you wanted to make sure, you asked them to write on their private world or something :)
[*9499] texterman: e
[*9499] texterman: i mean
[*9499] texterman: collect my text....
[*7274] fp: what's the farthest distance that you managed to strike an active conversation with someone?
[*1455] yosicat: yep, and then there's the small town effect where the regulars all began to know each other purely on text alone (which is how me and rscr became friends)
[*9499] texterman: collect my text....
[*1022] Dipper Pines: fuck my life
[*1022] Dipper Pines: my mother died
[*1022] Dipper Pines: we were evicted
[*7274] fp: if false memories aren't being implanted, then for me it was probably at Y: 100
[*1022] Dipper Pines: and the niggas kept fighting
[*7274] fp: on ywot
[*1022] Dipper Pines: all within 2 months of each other
[*1455] yosicat: fp i've once followed someone's cursor using js to x-2000 y-2000 but they didnt reply back :(
[*1022] Dipper Pines: we're escaping the country and seeking asylum
[*1022] Dipper Pines: y'all want to escape the country with me tomorrow?
[*4231] kkb: yosicat, it was a simpler time :D i like this chat window but at the same time i recognize the downside that it takes away more lively chat on the canvas itself
[*4231] kkb: fp: most convos went to the bottom right; x100 y-100 seems like a good guess considering some convos went for hours
[*1022] Dipper Pines: this is the f*CKING reason why I can read an article of a plane crashing and still get a laugh about it. f*ck America.
[*7274] fp: that might be part of it, but I believe it's also to do with how inhospitable the canvas can get at times with these spam scripts
[*4231] kkb: then again, 100 is a lot :D i have no idea really. but it was far enoguh to just reload the page instead of scrolling all the way back to 0,0
[*4231] kkb: fp: agreed. way more than ywot, owot seems ilke a playground for scripters. which can be fun if for things like the clock, or the carrion (i just learned its name lol) but spamming and slowing shit down is ugh
[*7274] fp: those kinds of long conversations have happened on owot before, I've seen one go down really far
[*7274] fp: I'm especially impressed with the one that exclusively used one of those bigtext scripts, so it was a supersized conversation
[*4231] kkb: yeah it's fun to stumble upon one like 20 coords away, that obviously started somewhere near spawn
[*4231] kkb: i guess bigtext makes it easier to get to 100 haha
[82]: fp
[*4231] kkb: whoever is scripting the clock: if you make the bouncing balls a bit bigger, maybe you can turn each one into a small clock too
[82]: remember the big text script that was on the sop a long time ago
[82]: what happened to that
[*8774] MrBlack: kkb, good idea but I don't think I have enough bandwidth for that
[*7274] fp: people spammed too much with the script
[*4231] kkb: i made a font on ywot a long time ago (still on my page) and i saw some people having a conversation with it; i felt honored, but a bit embarrassed at the same time because i implicitly contributed to spam :D
[82]: is there a chance it will be added. back
[*1455] yosicat: oh my god...... ITS MR BLAAAACCCKKKK
[*7274] fp: as long as people won't spam with it
[*8774] MrBlack: it's my old pal yosi!
[*1455] yosicat: chenn and tony's dead what's new
[*8774] MrBlack: Black is back baby
[82]: i really liked the big text script
[82]: if theres a chance it can be added back im happy :)
[*4231] kkb: black: i thought the computations were done on your machine, and the resulting tiles pushed to owot? if the entire thing is updated anyway it shouldn't be a data/bandwith prob? (i could be wrong though)
[*887] texterman: wheres stan pines bro
[*8774] MrBlack: it's a delicate balance of FPS and how many updates I push through
[*8774] MrBlack: I'd like to keep it at 20fps, which is about 25 character updates per frame
[*8774] MrBlack: yosicat, I spoke to chenn a little while ago and he said he 'retired' from ywot
[*4231] kkb: but the computations for clock, hands, bouncing balls, are all JS on your own machine, shouldn't those computations be infinitely faster than pushing the frames?
[*4231] kkb: (well not infinitely, but order of magnitude, rather)
[*8774] MrBlack: yeah, all JS done on my machine, if I try and push too many tile updates (for instance drawing large bouncing clocks) it will rate limit me
[*8774] MrBlack: and causes it to stutter badly
[*8774] MrBlack: I could get away with maybe 3 very small clocks bouncing around :D
[*8699] CarlBatman: On September 1st this year, I will light my testicles on fire for Cbatic Awareness #FREETHECBATERSOFREDDIT.

[3591]: is that a pizza eaten by spies, or a pizza that spies on people
[*4231] kkb: black: alright that makes sense; i assumed your script was something like 1) generate the pixels (clock, hands, balls, etc)   2) generate tile with the correct octants  3) send the tile.   And then steps 1-3 for each frame. It would mean you can do all the heavy lifting in step 1 without worrying about bandwith
[3591]: is that a pizza eaten by spies, or a pizza that spies on people
[*4231] kkb: but now i realize maybe you don't push all the characters and tiles at once, but only the ones that need updating
[*8028] Gutter: what if it's both
[*4231] kkb: owot *should* be able to send entire tiles at a decent frame rate, because i've seen people use video convertor scripts that use like 3x2 tiles to send video
[*3506] MrBlack: yea, maybe it is and I don't know the secret sauce how to do that yet
[*4231] kkb: me either, but i was amazed at how well that worked, i even drew a tv set around it lol
[*3506] MrBlack: haha nice I wish I saw it
[*4231] kkb: i just checked my tv set textfile, the video content was 7x3 tiles even
[*4231] kkb: (minue 1 horizontal line)
[3591]: guess it could
[*4231] kkb: i never understand why ip's running scripts like that aren't rate limited or auto-throttled/muted
[3591]: the spies order pizza and their opponents send a pizza that spies on the spies
[*9774] fp: owot's backend is poorly optimized, so it's impressive that these scripts are working as smoothly as they are
[*4866] CarlBatman: I hate bonzicuck
[3591]: the ultimate spy pizza
[*4866] CarlBatman: (He's never had sex to cbat)
[*9774] fp: this latency issue you're experiencing right now though has nothing to do with that
[*9774] fp: it's just the cheap server
[*4231] kkb: haha
[*1335] realredtext-: .
[*4231] kkb: no worries, fun scripts are a bonus and probably challenging to make, loading some tiles and typing text doesn't require a high-end server with so few concurrent users
[*982] MrBlack: this is highly optimised when compared to ywot to my eyes :D
[*4231] kkb: agreed
[*4231] kkb: spam wars on ywot were enough to leave the site for a while and wait it out, that seriously f'd up everything
[4759]: Your mom is gay
[*4231] kkb: i've seen spam wars on owot that were messy, but it rarely ever slowed the site down or prevented me from chatting or visiting other worlds
[1527]: 4759 guess what i did to your mom last night
[*9774] fp: right, and I think it was until 2016 that things got way better in that regard
[*4231] kkb: fp: on a totally different note, i was trying to add a link-to-coordinates to a character, and including a note:. is that something on the backlog?
[*4231] kkb: i'm imagining a "create link" menu with a radiobutton to choose URL or Coordinates (setting extra fields as necessary), and then a "tooltip" field that would add the "note"
[*4231] kkb: essentially an all-in-one jump function :)
[*9774] fp: I can put it on the backlog
[*4231] kkb: should technically be possible to combine, since note is hover, and url/coordinates are href
[*4231] kkb: thanks!
[*4231] kkb: come to think of it, probably onclick and not href, but still seperate from hover ;)

[3372]: infinity minus 5500 is still infinity.
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Wrong
[*3887] Catzcute4: no
[*3887] Catzcute4: infinity minus 5500 is infinity
[*3887] Catzcute4: v
[3372]: also, infinity is not a number
[*3887] Catzcute4: let’s prove it: two sets have the same cardinality iff there exist a bijectuon between their elements
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: STOP TELLING THAT TO ME
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: INFINITY MINUS 5500 = INFINITY MINUS 550
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: *5500
[*3887] Catzcute4: the set of ℕ (the natrual numbers, with cardinality א‎₀) and the set with 5500 more elements (the union of all numbers from -5500 to -1 inclusive) is the same cardinality since I can subtract 5500
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: NO
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: STOP
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: STOP
[*3887] Catzcute4: if you say this makes no sense, well, if I can find a bijection (1:1 mapping) between finite sets, then they are the same size right?
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Yeah
[*3887] Catzcute4: for example, there’s one between out usernames: C<->S, c<->a(0), etc
[*3887] Catzcute4: that’s making them the same size
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: 1:1 = 1
[3372]: if orange is not in the color pallette, then why is there orange on the canvas then?
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Because : (Colon) Is Division
[*3887] Catzcute4: sciencegd i’m saying for every letter in your username there is exactly one in mine, which makes them equal size
[*1520] giMmIcKcelLaR: back in my day there was a link to /m4k
[*3887] Catzcute4: do you think that definition makes sense?
[*3887] Catzcute4: (debating with sciencegd on the fact that א‎₀+5500 = א‎₀)

[*3887] Catzcute4: oh hi
[*3887] Catzcute4: anyways so do you think my definiton of equal size makes sense?
[*3887] Catzcute4: (two things are equal size iff for every element in the first one there is exactly one in the second one)
[*3887] Catzcute4: (like for every letter in your username there is exactly one in mine)

[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: ARE YOU ON PHONE/TABLET?????????
[*3887] Catzcute4: ye
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Same Size = True
[*3887] Catzcute4: ok good then
[*3887] Catzcute4: now, here: if I have a set of natrual numbers, its size is infinity, right?
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Yeah
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Yeah
[*3887] Catzcute4: ok
[*3887] Catzcute4: so now if I remove the first 5500 elements of ℕ (the set of natrual numbers) from a copy of it, I have subtracted 5500 from infinity.
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: So}
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: HGBKDJSGVFDHGVDHGFDHGF
[*3887] Catzcute4: (so every number from 0 to 4499 is gone)
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: You Mean
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Every 0 To 5499?
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Gone?
[*3887] Catzcute4: ye
[*3887] Catzcute4: (from this copy of the natruals)
[*3887] Catzcute4: it has 5500 “less” elements now, right?
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Then It Means That Theres An Amount Of ∞-5,500 Natrual Numbers
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: See?
[*3887] Catzcute4: yes.

[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: *Talking About Me
[*3887] Catzcute4: but now: for every natrual number, a natrual number in the new set exists: add 5500 to it
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Yeah
[*3887] Catzcute4: and for every natrual number in the new set, there is one in the normal natrual numbers: subtract 5500 from it.
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: *Goes Back Numbers From 0 To 4,499*
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: *Makes It Gone*
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: ∞-5,500 To ∞ To ∞-5,500
[*3887] Catzcute4: this means for every element the set with size א‎₀ there is exactly one in the set with size א‎₀-5500
[*8074] ScienceGD [∞-5,500/∞]: Hehe Boi

[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > 4458 juno is racist and homophobic, no
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: why does that rule out an apology?
[*5029] Schjessu: im not gona quit trolling him until he learns how to deal with trolls :3
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: being nicer to juno may encourage him to form connections with us, which could weaken his homophobia/racism
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ok but trolling him isn't making him do that so consider other strategies
[*5029] Schjessu: make him into a leftie? impossible
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ya think it'd be easier if you didn't ruin his first impression on woke owoters
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: =w=
[*5029] Schjessu: nah
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: if we want him to at least be nicer we should be nicer to him too
[*5029] Schjessu: i wanna keep trolling
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: if we keep harassing him off he's just gonna return and spew his shit again
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: not what we want
[*5029] Schjessu: but funny
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yeah but ineffective
[*5029] Schjessu: but funny
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: for you
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: funny is short-term anyway
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: what if juno goes on to convince others
[*5029] Schjessu: hm
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: because we didn't end the cycle
[*5029] Schjessu: nah
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yeah it's  possible though
[*5029] Schjessu: ur on what ifs now
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i mean it applies only if R0 of homophobia is >1
[*5029] Schjessu: the only ppl hes convincing are his stormfront buddies
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: but still
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: what if he goes on to harass other gay people with his stormfront buddies off the internet
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i think that's kinda likely
[*5029] Schjessu: teach more ppl how to handle trolls? cool
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: thats like..
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: not what harassment does
[*5029] Schjessu: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well sometimes it does do that but there's better ways
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: obviously better ways
[*5029] Schjessu: junotehtranny
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: look what i'm saying is for the small small price of entertainment, we can form positive connections with juno so he doesn't bother us
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: smaaaalllllll
[*5029] Schjessu: okay but what abt the anons
[*8571] yoo: who posted 123 E 38th St New York, New York, USA
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: tell him to ignore them
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: give him a script to autoblock anons
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: or get in the habit of telling him to block anons every time hes seen on owot
[*5029] Schjessu: and then he'll autoblock anoyone that he doesnt agree with
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: he doesnt know js
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: bweh
[*5029] Schjessu: idk js
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and he's not done that yk
[*5029] Schjessu: i can still edit it
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: he's TERRIBLE at blocking you
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: his chat colour goes red before he does that
[*5029] Schjessu: i go by the thingo thingamabob that no one ever blocks
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ?
[*5029] Schjessu: i dont ever see ppl actually blocking others
[*5029] Schjessu: i just dont see it happen
[*5029] Schjessu: anyways no im not gonna quit trolling juno
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: guh
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: he's just gonna keep returning then
[*9783] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and being toxic
