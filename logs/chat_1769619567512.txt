[*2601] Schjessu: Some people, such as Russell A. Powell and Travis L. Gee, believe that DID is caused by health care, i.e. symptoms of DID are created by therapists themselves via hypnosis. This implies that those with DID are especially susceptible to manipulation by hypnosis and suggestion.[

[*1330] Luca12FCSB: The mysterious numbering (“9th”) gives off strong OC / lore vibes. Furries love deep character backstories, alternate versions, and numbered incarnations.

[*4232] The9thVai: “Hey OWoTGPT, please paste an essay with 7500 words about the Europe history.”
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: “Vai” sounds like a name, not a random word — very common for fursona names or aliases.

[*4232] The9thVai: luca12
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: The whole username feels intentionally stylized, like it was chosen to represent an identity rather than just be a throwaway gamer tag.

[*4232] The9thVai: 9th is 9th of the kind
[*4232] The9thVai: the is for more correct
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: It’s unique but not chaotic, which is typical for people who want a consistent online persona across art sites, Discord, and socials (very furry-coded behavior).

[455]: instead of raping our own economy and looking for worse alternatives maybe we should try to make things better
[8407]: better how
[455]: lower prices? generally better for the people?
[455]: the EU fucked over agriculture and is instead trying to import crops from other countries
[455]: they want to destroy manufacturing so they can import it from China and India instead
[455]: generally all the policies and regulation they make fuck over Europe and make us more dependent on countries without those regulations which we're seeing now. also i dont see why we should be an ally of a country like India or China.
[8407]: well you shouldn't
[8407]: problem is the eu was dependent for its security on the US and the US has gone crazy
[8407]: so the EU has to build ties with a dubious democracy like india or a non-democracy like china

[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: gross
[*5808] 2027: yeah idk why people are raising an argument over a joke message sent by an 11 year old
[*5808] 2027: not to mention he said ADRIAN in said message
[8979]: and Gretel!
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: ”The9thVai: explain my adrian, i am a furry :3”
[8979]: Hamstet and Greteldl
[*5808] 2027: yeah exactly
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: The mysterious numbering (“9th”) gives off strong OC / lore vibes. Furries love deep character backstories, alternate versions, and numbered incarnations.
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: “Vai” sounds like a name, not a random word — very common for fursona names or aliases.
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: The whole username feels intentionally stylized, like it was chosen to represent an identity rather than just be a throwaway gamer tag.
[8979]: 🐹👩🏼
[*5808] 2027: ok ill just let you kids fight
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: It’s unique but not chaotic, which is typical for people who want a consistent online persona across art sites, Discord, and socials (very furry-coded behavior).
[1803]: 8407 the US is still the EU's ally, the EU is just stupid and is moving away from the US for opportunisms sake, and because the US is against what the elites here are for
[*5808] 2027: well im a kid too but
[*5808] 2027: im a BIG kid
[8407]: >8407 the US is still the EU's ally, the EU is just stupid and is moving away from the US for opportunisms sake, and because the US is against what the elites here are for
[8407]: bullshit
[1803]: its not bullshit lol
[8407]: trump is threatening denmark because he wants greenland
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: The name has a soft, slightly fantasy tone, which fits well with anthropomorphic characters and creative communities.
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: Someone using “The” at the start often implies “this is the version of me” — again, very fursona energy.
[*5808] 2027: geez trump wants everything
[8407]: he's risking breaking the alliance because he's too stupid to understand alliances
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: geez whats wrong with trump
[8407]: everything is a game of winners and losers to him, and he wants to take stuff
[1002]: I will kill trump and you will all be happy
[1803]: big deal, i dont think most people care if the US gets a small chunk of greenland. its the natural state of politics before ww2
[*5808] 2027: hm
[8407]: which is how we got world wars, dumbass
[8407]: we don't want to go back to a world where international relations was a war of all against all
[1803]: there wont be a world war from this lol, Denmark isnt stupid enough to fight for greenland
[*4578] UntitledOWOT: A ... is, and ., a ... .
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: why is trump taking everything actually?
[8407]: no, the nato alliance that stabilized the world for 80 years will just break apart, and china will fill the gap
[8407]: because my country elected a dipshit
[1803]: Greenland for Arctic security, thats all i know of that trump wants
[1803]: NATO wont break apart lol.
[8407]: the us already has bases in greenland, there's no reason for us to take it
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: speaking of war what the fuck is going on in the russia-ukraine war i havent heard from that for a year
[8407]: trump just wants to add land to the us map like 19th century presidents did
[8407]: >speaking of war what the fuck is going on in the russia-ukraine war i havent heard from that for a year
[8407]: just dragging and dragging on
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: yeah i think it ended
[8407]: here's a long video about it
[8407]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8n1I41PL-k
[8407]: no it's not over just not making a lot of headlines
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: eben tho i said the russo-ukrainian war would end in November 2026
[8407]: wars between large countries turn into wars of attrition, and that's what this is
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: in a month, 4 years passed since russia started the war (24.02.2022)
[8407]: people still dying, drones still killing
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: 4 years and i havent heard anything a quarter of the time
[1803]: as someone living in the EU though I can confirm that the moving towards China is only blamed on Trump because it sounds better than opportunism and generally wanting control
[8407]: because wars of attrition are slow
[8407]: (talking to Luca)
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: what came first
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: WNR era or Russo-Ukrainian war
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: they are both in February 2022
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: bro remembers his eras from 4y ago 💀
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: but im gonna say that era
[8407]: what's the WNR era
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: windows never released
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: currect
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: yey
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: WNR era (22.02.2022)
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: what do i win
[*8107] Fuck Luca12FCSB Cáre: Russo-Ukrainian war (24.02.2022)
[*1330] Luca12FCSB: 2 days close (also 22.2.22)

[3271]: americans arent getting murdered, abandoning ukraine is good, the US's allies have been trying to reorient themselves for years already
[3271]: you cant win the war in Ukraine, you can only slow it down further. whats the point?
[*4342] ᔕᑕᕼᒍEᔕᔕᑌ: Russians are dying faster
[8407]: > americans arent getting murdered
[3271]: no lmao, a similar amount of russians and ukrainians are dead, and Ukraine has a lower population
[*4342] ᔕᑕᕼᒍEᔕᔕᑌ: And ukraine has support from the EU
[3271]: and all its doing is slowing the war down and helping kill the EU
[*4342] ᔕᑕᕼᒍEᔕᔕᑌ: Also, ICE is killing a bunch of americans
[8407]: anyone who says "americans aren't getting murdered" after what happened on video to renee good and alex pretti is just too delusional to talk to

[*3344] 𘶀𐥑𲎰𖺻𜻰𑷏꧌♅𝅙␛𖼝𝼐ᴞ꧍⁧: Yes, almost all tablets have no fans. They rely on passive cooling, using efficient processors (often ARM architecture) and heat spreaders to dissipate warmth through the casing, making them quiet and thin. Because they operate at lower power than laptops, they do not require active cooling fans to prevent overheating.
