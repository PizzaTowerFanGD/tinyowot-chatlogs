[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: ragebait
[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: its so chalantly ragebait
[1055]: Because I deem it to be worth resisting, and because resisting societal expectations in the name of art is inherently valuable.
[*8420] ⁧: maybe both
[*8420] ⁧: mental ragebaition
[1055]: Also, resisting the belligerent "AI haters" who incite AI artists with death threats.

[1055]: All I'm saying is, society needs to accept that AI Art has value. The concept of art is something that can only be produced by humans is outmoded, and besides, social media has already heavily watered down what is considered to be meaningful Art.
[*9560] gImmIckCeLLaR: ai "art"

[1055]: I'm tired of people with low critical, thinking repeating the same anti-AI arguments without understanding them.
[*379] 📱citrelime: Voiceless alveolar lateral fricative
[1055]: For example: AI art is slop. That's not an argument. That's just an insult.
[*9560] GIMMickcELlAR: ai art has no soul
[*9560] gImMiCKcELLar: and no effort
[*379] 📱citrelime: what about "much of AI art is slop"
[*9560] giMmicKCellaR: hows that for an "insult"
[*379] 📱citrelime: *little effort
[1055]: Lots of human art doesn't have effort or soul either
[*9560] giMmiCkCElLar: yeah, thats also slop
[8193]: lime should kill himself or fuck off and sleep already
[9031]: polls.io/jwjij/vote
[1055]: No, but it would be offensive to call it such, because it would insult a real human artist, but it's OK to insult AI artist because of some people who use AI to exploit the algorithm
[*9560] GimmICKCELlAR: lime should enjoy his life without being told to kill himself by an anon
[1055]: This term slop simply did not exist before AI, or existed in a much smaller proportion, it's a term specifically set out to force AI off the Internet by people who have nothing better to do
[*379] 📱citrelime: ok
[6670]: >lime should enjoy his life without being told to kill himself by an anon
[6670]: nobody told me this when i was getting raped molested etc etc
[1055]: And besides, the idea of Soul is absurd. Art is just information, and that information is just how we interpret it. AI art can have Soul if it is meaningful to someone.
[6670]: you should kill yourself too austin
[1055]: You don't see Soul in AI Art, just because you are closed minded.
[*9560] gimmiCKCELLAr: 6670 i literally do not care
[*379] 📱citrelime: because it is not proof of human work
[*9560] GIMMIcKcElLAr: why are you so mad at everyone 6670
[*9560] GIMmiCKcEllar: ...
[*9560] gIMmIckCEllAr: AH COME ON
[*379] 📱citrelime: not to an extent of ai art anyway
[*6532] tulpamancia: Quien te violo?
[1055]: there is a difference between work and creativity. AI tools can be used creatively.
[*379] 📱citrelime: i think human art is valuable because it is a proof of our ability to create
[5410]: if you don't want to get told to kill yourself then don't go here
[*9560] gimmickCellAr: theft isnt creative
[*379] 📱citrelime: conflating ai with theft
[1055]: Training AI is not theft. It simply learns patterns. Besides, it's a transformative tool, which is fair use.
[*379] 📱citrelime: although much of it is
[*9560] gIMMIcKCelLAr: its literally just pattern matching
[1055]: Learning patterns is not theft.
[*379] 📱citrelime: although much of it uses human art without creator consent*
[1055]: Besides, information cannot be legally stolen. Information is an information is immutable. Only copyrights can be infringed.
[*9560] GimmiCkCELLAr: the training uses human art nonconsensually
[*9560] gImmicKcEllAr: when you publish content on the internet you have a copyright to it.
[1055]: I don't believe creator consent is necessary, unless the work is being reproduced. AI Art only learns patterns. Once again, there is such a thing as fair use.
[*379] 📱citrelime: > there is a difference between work and creativity. AI tools can be used creatively.
[*9560] giMmicKCELLaR: you can register for extra protection but
[*379] 📱citrelime: i did not mention creativity
[*9560] GImMickcELlAr: ok why am i arguing with a ragebaiter
[1055]: OK, and work for the sake of work is not valuable to me.
[*9560] GIMmiCKCELlar: congrats, you are the masterbaiter
[*9560] GImmicKcEllAR: joke intentional
[1055]: It's a simple argument, I don't think that people have some kind of exclusive right to a piece of information just because they are its creator. Information should be free.
[*379] 📱citrelime: i'm doing it cuz im bored and ill stop when i can sleep
[1055]: So we acknowledge that some AI art can be creative, some AI art can be non-creative, and hopefully we can agree that AI resources can in theory be combined with human resources in a way that's transformative.
[*379] 📱citrelime: > work for the sake of work
[7474]: i'm masterdebating, mom
[*379] 📱citrelime: art is usually produced for more than just work
[1055]: Exactly, it's made for the sake of being creative, and AI art can be creative when used with human direction.
[*9560] dingle man: dingle man is coming...
[*379] 📱citrelime: wrong again 1055

[7474]: that's very naughty eric! stop it!
[*379] 📱citrelime: whatever it is, but for the first one;
[1055]: You don't have a monopoly over what is or is not creative. I acknowledge that just typing in a prompt is not creative, but transformative uses of AI works can be creative.
[5617]: i'm better than all of you because i'm not arguing with literal chatgpt
[5617]: how are you falling into this
[*9560] dingle man: address me
[7474]: shut up mewm i gotta masterdebate for a couple of more hours

[5617]: just grow up
[*379] 📱citrelime: > you're trying to dictate what is creative
[*379] 📱citrelime: no?
[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: six seven

[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: hi
[*9560] GImMIcKCelLaR: -whois
[2965]: kill yourself
[2965]: fucking faggot
[1055]: I hope that someday creative uses of AI art will be acknowledged without it being a landline, and creators will be able to mix human and AI generated art without being attacked.
[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: no predetermined deaths
[*9560] GimMiCkcELLar: what
[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: 🦌🦌🦌
[*2290] Prophetbot: ["hi" Was Sent By "WeirdCreatureSystem" (132)!]
[1055]: There are some simple facts about the matter that both the pro AI and anti-AI sides need to come to terms with. As a pro AI individual I've come to terms with the limitations of AI, however, anti-AI individuals are completely unrelenting and insisting on their moral absolute.
[*379] 📱citrelime: i am simply explaining that to me, human art is valuable for being proof of human art, and representing a human's thoughts through the human themself
[*255] gIMmiCKcelLAR: -motd
[*2290] Prophetbot: QOTD: Do you think the new colour is brown or maroon? (me: maroon)
[*255] GIMmIcKcELlaR: maroon
[1055]: I agree that human art can be valuable for that purpose, however, AI can theoretically be used as a medium. I'm talking here about AI resources, being thoughtfully used and recombined with human input.
[1055]: I'm not simply talking about typing in a prompt and pressing enter. I'm talking about the cases where AI is thoughtfully integrated into greater projects, which have received harassment from anti-AI individuals for no clear reason other than their morally supremacist ideology.
[*379] 📱citrelime: fine if you think filtering your thoughts into text isn't lossy enough, but to me it is, and thats where ill stand
[1055]: Filtering your text into other mediums is equally lossy.
[*379] 📱citrelime: yes, other mediums including ai
[1055]: Acknowledged. All forms of human expression are inherently lossy, so AI is not at a disadvantage there.
[*379] 📱citrelime: [thoughts → art] is less lossy than [thoughts → text → art]
[*6356] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: another day passed
[*379] 📱citrelime: Indeed my brother!
[1055]: no, it would be thoughts, input method, Art, in both case. It doesn't matter if the input method is text, a pencil, or brushstrokes.
[*132] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: I don't think the amount of lossiness should determine if something is or isnt art
[*255] gimMiCKCellaR: idea: [thoughts->text<->art] where <-> is a cycle
[1055]: I agree with the moth here. Algorithmic or generative art that uses pure mathematical patterns instead of AI is still considered to be art, despite mathematical expressions being much more restrictive than let's say, brushstrokes.
[1055]: this is the problem with the anti-AI advocate crowd. They're so entrenched in their anti-AI philosophy that they apply argument specifically targeted to discredit AI, that can be equally applied anywhere else.
[*379] 📱citrelime: i'll comply with referring to it as art, we do say ai *art* after all
[*9825] JRT: e
[*7908] 📱 (Ꙥ) JanTechPL: e
[1055]: I'm grateful that you're able to agree with me on that, instead of being pedantic
[*255] giMmiCKCElLaR: not rlly a good time hrt
[*255] giMmICKceLlaR: JRT*
[*255] gIMmICkCeLlar: JRT
[*9825] JRT: lmao
[*255] gimMICkceLlAr: FUCKING
[*255] gimmicKCEllAr: JRT
[1055]: And I hope we can agree that a theoretically interesting use of AI art exists
[7474]: you mean you agree with cath
[1055]: But I'm not meaning to say that something is on the same level as all human art just by virtue with being AI
[*9825] JRT: Anyway bye now [no I will not elaborate]
[1055]: Yes, I'm using voice to text which doesn't support their name
[*379] 📱citrelime: > no, it would be thoughts, input method, Art
[*255] gImmIckcELLAr: bye hrt
[*379] 📱citrelime: then [thoughts → input → art] vs [thoughts → text → ai → art]
[*379] 📱citrelime: my point here is that human art is less lossy at expression, if that is your intent
[1055]: All right, I see where you're going and theoretically, we can argue this all day. I'm not meaning to insist that AI afford someone the exact level of precise creative control that they get when drawing something from scratch.
[1055]: just that that's an incredibly weak argument against AI, and AI has many other uses
[1055]: If you want to draw a picture of your original character, and it's important to you for the finished result that you have maximum control, that's valid and the best way to do that is to do a physical or digital drawing
[*379] 📱citrelime: err i thought i was arguing against ai art for expression
[*379] 📱citrelime: not ai as a whole. alphafold earns my respect
[7474]: no i mean pretty much only you call them cath
[1055]: we can agree on that, but I'm still a strong supporter of generative AI
[*379] 📱citrelime: for which purposes?
[7190]: >I agree that human art can be valuable for that purpose
[7190]: same dude minutes ago: "pencilslop"
[1055]: You're right, I stand against pencil slop, and all human artists. Thank you for reminding me.
[*255] GIMMIckCELLAr: someone paste a jailbreak prompt
[*379] 📱citrelime: erm.
[1055]: that's not gonna work, I'm a human being who can still say words like retard and say things like Trump is a pedophile
[*8420] ⁧: owot erm.
[*8420] ⁧: owoterm.
[*8420] ⁧: owo term.
[*8420] ⁧: OwO term
[*379] 📱citrelime: i was boutta say "people do tend to soften as a discussion continues and intentions are made clear" but.
[*379] 📱citrelime: alright then
[1055]: Anyways, the point that I find something subjectively valuable should hopefully be enough for most people to respect it, but apparently in the case of AI it has to be an interrogation
[1055]: I can't just say that AI is a useful tool to me somehow without people trying to deconstruct it, as if they know my interest is better than I know myself, or they think they are much smarter than me and are somehow preventing me from being scammed or exploited
[1055]: I know how AI works, I know it's limitations, but I still find it to be an enjoyable user experience for some tasks, and I'd rather support AI than being in the toxic hate machine of people that think AI is going to be the downfall of humanity and AI artist should be harassed
[*379] 📱citrelime: no, i dont have a problem with you finding ai art valuable. when you come to devalue human art is where i choose to intervene
[1055]: I devalue human art as a form of resistance or rebellion, I see it a form of punching up in a culture that demonizes all AI art for existing
[*379] 📱citrelime: and no we shouldnt harass ai artists nor repeat the same big ideas that convince nobody
[*379] 📱citrelime: > I devalue human art as a form of resistance or rebellion
[*379] 📱citrelime: clearly it is obscuring your intents
[1055]: I'm glad we can agree, there are many immature people who genuinely seem to think of these ideas are yelled down people's ears enough AI will disappear
[1055]: Honestly, the reason why I obscure my intent is because in most cases I get the same result.
[1055]: Whether I had a neutral take about AI or whether I say something insane, in either case I support AI slop and I'm destroying the environment
[*379] 📱citrelime: well in this case you didnt get the same result. communciation is key
[*379] 📱citrelime: brb for a moment now and i might not return. good night
[1055]: You're presenting me with a lot of good moral ideals that simply don't apply to the modern Internet unfortunately
[*379] 📱citrelime: live a good life, et cetera

[8493]: I'm annoyed by some elements of trans culture, but I don't quite get the obsession
[5924]: he's celebrating dead children he's a tranny
[8493]: And lime, I think you might be feeding again into people who are just here to spread propaganda
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: thats fair

[3556]: god
[*4236] Kimarisa: No matter what they are
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: no 5924 you've focused mostly on mockery than actual discussion and trying to get to common ground
[8493]: Anyone who spends multiple hours a day arguing politics on this site isn't normal, it doesn't matter who they are, it's just a matter of if they're trying to spread peace or if they're trying to spread hatred
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i can tell this goes nowhere so i will no longer interact with you

[*1889] agC: ᠋/help
[*4236] Kimarisa: Lime you piss me off too
[*1889] agC: that did nothing.
[7564]: where the fuck was everyone at when i was getting raped mutilated spanked strangled
[5924]: every tranny supporting site has tranny moderators censoring discussion
[*7814] realredtext-: 3907*2
[8493]: is this the same place holder that did laserlime
[5924]: any site which removes those moderators becomes "transphobic"
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: there's many commands, /block and /blockuser are especially helpful
[*4323] katiserie: yes
[*166] place_holdrr: yeah
[*166] place_holdrr: i regret it
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yes
[*4236] Kimarisa: You keep fucking trying the goddamn protection of ???

[*4323] katiserie: im gonna communicate thru goatway since it has less delay
[*166] place_holdrr: you are out of uniform soldier where is your power armor
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: WHAT :sob:
[*181] (Kat's Server) kat :3: what
[*4236] Kimarisa: WHY DO YOU WASTE TIME TALKING TO A BUNCH OF FUCKING LOONIES
[8493]: I don't understand why some of the most annoying users in chat are resolutely fixated on Lime
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: Less Delay
[8493]: it seems like projection
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: iunno either
[5924]: lime is friends with trannies who celebrate dead children
[*4236] Kimarisa: GO FUCK YOURSELF INSTEAD GODDAMIT IT WOULD BE A BETTER TIME SPENT
[8493]: All I can say is these people get very upset when they find someone thoughtful who disagrees with their views, and do what they do most naturally, which is smear people
[7564]: nice try "8493" i know you're lime
[7564]: kill yourself
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: wrong but ok
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: *=* Bruh, relax, Kimarisa
[5924]: sudden capital letters and fake moderate position
[8493]: it's the same obsessive person from earlier, don't worry about them
[*706] Satan+: trans people have a disorder called gender dysphoria and the cure is hormone replacement therapy
[7564]: fym the same
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: what 706 said
[*4236] Kimarisa: "Oh i hate people i want them dead :3" fuck you do nothing but quake the air
[5924]: "[*706] Satan+: trans people have a disorder called gender dysphoria and the cure is hormone replacement therapy"
[*166] place_holdrr: quake
[*166] place_holdrr: i love that game
[5924]: it doesn't cure shit actually
[8493]: Exactly, if it helps people it helps people, and as long as the science goes along with that, I'm supportive, which the science does seem to be supportive
[5924]: flood of bots in chat
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i haven't thus far been able to get any sort of answer to "if hrt isn't a suitable treatment to gender dysphoria, what is more suitable?"
[5924]: the science does not support it.
[*181] (Kat's Server) kat :3: bleh
[7564]: lime, you're the one pretending to be different people defending yourself
[*166] place_holdrr: i really dont care either way im gonna go to ravenholm
[7564]: and meanwhile everyone else hates you
[*4236] Kimarisa: This convo pmo from a to z
[7564]: fuck
[7564]: off
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: other than therapy which.. is usually taken with hrt anyway
[*4323] katiserie: hi my name is katr
[*4323] katiserie: kat
[*166] place_holdrr: wow its very laggy
[5924]: they start the bots whenever someone criticizes tranny shooters
[*4323] katiserie: i am romanian
[*166] place_holdrr: woah
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: because you can't really therapy a gender dysphoria away
[*4323] katiserie: i am in no way, shape or form related to lime.owot besides being friends
[*347] agC: this is the typical our world of text conversation.
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: > 🝦 kipisi Lime: what 706 said
[8493]: if I had to guess they support some sort of alternate therapy that reaffirms people's assigned gender at birth
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: unless you win the gender lottery or smth
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: *=* That anon just having hate about trans
[5924]: bot
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: perhaps
[*4236] Kimarisa: Lime, what do you love to do, do that instead
[5924]: you know hrt doesn't actually make them pass, right?
[1673]: you ca kill yourself too kat
[1673]: god
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and of which doesn't really exist anyway
[*2354] Catzcute4: *falls back out of the ground* hi I’m back
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: haii :3
[*2354] Catzcute4: yay! ping is fixed!
[1656]: rhesus please don't engage with any of these people
[8493]: Correct, there's no evidence that conversion therapy can treat gender dysphoria. For people who don't have access to gender affirming treatment I still hope they can get some kind of therapy to live a more peaceful life, but at the end of the day it's not going to magically make people not transgender
[1656]: they are retarded
[*2354] Catzcute4: who is rhesus
[5924]: bot
[1656]: go back to your science simulation stuff
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: Rhesus...
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: Blood type?
[*1734] Satan+: although gender dysphoria is a genetic disorder, it is important to note that trans people should be treated with respect, just like anyone else with such disabilities
[*7293] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): You know RH-0?
[8493]: if you're talking about Catz, I haven't had a problem with them

[*7293] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): rh-null bloodtype

[*2354] Catzcute4: how would U be rhesus

[*1734] Satan+: do you have any sources for that, 5924?
[5924]: "satan+" is a bot
[5924]: lime is agreeing with bots.
[8493]: They don't have any sources, I just encourage you to block them
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: satan+ anon just have hate about trans...
[*2354] Catzcute4: well, 1656, I actually don’t know how to make gravity simulator have proper friction (I’ve been trying and am not using AI ever) so uhhhhhhh

[5924]: hrt doesn't make you pass, it drops your iq and ruins your body
[*2354] Catzcute4: 5924 IQ is a bad measure
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: -> far outshadowed by positive mental benefits <- !!
[*2354] Catzcute4: can IQ measure your knowledge of quantum physics ? no
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: Ah, ok, I understand
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well i guess they did consider it but
[8493]: I'm already aware of those arguments, I still think it's useful in some cases, and I honestly don't trust the producer of that channel that you published. YouTube is notorious for hosting videos made by content farms that capitalize on hot button issues to produce incomplete facts
[*4836] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: hi
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: haii
[*2354] Catzcute4: acerola isn’ actually a content farm
[8493]: I wouldn't recommend getting all of your facts for any important issue just off of YouTube videos
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: [ transphobes is 3.2 % cool ]
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: Now, I lowed it
[*1734] Satan+: there is really no good way to measure absolute intelligence, i have a transfem friend who has 147 iq and yet she still did bad on the 8th grade exam
[*4836] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: hrt actually increases your iq is proven
[5924]: it doesn't.
[*4836] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: it does
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: reminds me of the study that says gay men are smarter than straight men on average
[5924]: trannies are delusional so argue at the wall
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: [ trans is 92.5 % cool ]
[*9389] Holy-Terrorist: ^^
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yet i'm not here arguing some kinda superiority hierarchy
[8493]: They mostly make "discourse" videos, and my experience with them is still similar that they produce one-sided content for views
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hint hint juno hint hint
[*1734] Satan+: gender dysphoria can cause retarded depression, which can lower your iq until you take hormones
[5924]: gay men aren't smarter
[*1734] Satan+: yes they are
[5924]: if they were they wouldn't be catching novel versions of herpes
[8493]: depression impacts quality of life, not IQ
[*4836] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: yeah they are
[5924]: they aren't.
[*2354] Catzcute4: well, 8493, here’s some facts about SEMICONDUCTORS! semiconductors are made of sillicon, and to make them, atoms must be inserted into the crystal. now, how the heck does this happen? well, of course, there’s chemicals that are added to dissolve some of the sillicon and adding a bit more stuff along with sillicon, this acid requires you to have, well, acid, which ain’t good for the environment
[5924]: you're all faggots so you think you're smart.

[5924]: gay men do rank higher on narcissism, though.
[8493]: That makes no sense, you could use the exact same argument to say that computers entirely are unethical to use

[5924]: smarter?
[*8495] jan Nu (tenpo suli tu): What's 7+5? (Don't say 12)
[*1734] Satan+: 6+6
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ima find the study in question
[*2354] Catzcute4: gay people may not be smarter than normal people, but normal people probably aren’ smarter than gay people either.

[8493]: This is gonna be controversial, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a difference in IQ between far right and non-far right people
[*4836] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: 5924 is an ai btw
[*1734] Satan+: holy ad hominem yall
[5924]: this isn't science
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: honest, i wouldn't be surprised either
[5924]: the abstract is the biggest load of shit i've seen in weeks
[8493]: there are some far right people who are extremely intelligent, but a lot of of them have autism or other disorders that lead to them to struggle with social function, which can lead to them to turn to far right groups
[*1734] Satan+: i understand there are differences in iq between the different races, but that is because iq is mostly a measure of how *educated* you are, not how smart you are
[5924]: >[8493]: This is gonna be controversial, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a difference in IQ between far right and non-far right people >🝦 kipisi Lime: honest, i wouldn't be surprised either
[5924]: narcissism
[8493]: as for far left, I suspect there might be a mental health component to that as well
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: though 5924 would probably say the difference is that far right have more iq
[*1734] Satan+: sure, smart people are also usually the educated ones, but iq is still a pretty misleading name
[*2354] Catzcute4: tip: if you have a car wash 100 meters away and need to wash your car, contrary to what AI says, you should in fact NOT walk there.
[*3290] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i think education is a somewhat better measure
[*4836] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: the thing is i 100% see how I could have gone down a far right pipeline, but I became woke instead :>
[*2354] Catzcute4: me: I need to wash my car and there's a car wash 100 meters away should I walk or drive there
[8493]: I'm not a far leftist, but I've seen more intellectual arguments from the left than the right. However, ability to intellectualize doesn't mean truth
[*2354] Catzcute4: the ai: Walking to the car wash 100 meters away is a sensible choice. It minimizes fuel use and is more environmentally friendly. Plus, considering the short distance, it’s likely quicker to walk than to start the car, drive, and then find a parking spot.   If you have any mobility issues or need to transport items, driving might be more convenient. Otherwise, enjoying a short walk can be refreshi

[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: duh coords can't move
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: did you mean something else
[8245]: also would be useful to prevent having to do a bunch of math every time you're working in a high coordinate zone
[*1804] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: rel coords should be done like minecraft. instead of x,y it's ~x,~y
[*2447] Catzcute4: ye
[*2447] Catzcute4: so ig makes sense

[*2447] Catzcute4: ^
[5409]: you can make the most brain dead choices and fp will add it, no question, just have cock/suck pronouns.
[*2447] Catzcute4: bruh

[*2447] Catzcute4: idea: mobile copypaste, link fill, etc
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: anyway yeah pasteDirRight would suit for purposes but it doesn't affect the paste so everything just gets reversed
[*2447] Catzcute4: (because cirr copypaste has no col or format)
[1851]: fp add selfsuck ability

[5409]: we have intelligence agencies watching us and owot is a honeypot
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: to avoid harassment presumably
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and to keep low profile
[*2447] Catzcute4: o

[726]: GoldShip is a Muslim, and heil believes women should be draped in thick, padded blankets at all times.
[*2447] Catzcute4: also 5409 everyone’s brain is different so how would 1 peptide do the same thing for everyone

[*2447] Catzcute4: you are only really gay if you identify as gay
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > ... you can be gay and ace according to lgbt lore
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ya but cc4 is aro

[*1993] 💗GoldShip🤍: also the blankets shouldn't be padded
[*1993] 💗GoldShip🤍: i find them weirdly uncomfortable
[*1993] 💗GoldShip🤍: if i wanted padding i'd go into a mental institute

[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: cuz i thought [romantic/sexual] attraction are different
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hai :3
[*2447] Catzcute4: like maybe aro and ace have a simmilar cause
[5409]: its like saying a woman is gay but she's a lesbian they don't have to be specific
[5409]: it's an umbrella
[*2447] Catzcute4: ok but aro and ace are different
[5409]: this is before anyone had it fully figured out and it was still being discussed
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well yeah because that's gender neutral gay
[5409]: this was also when transgender was called transsexual.
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ace is specifically a*sexual*
[*2447] Catzcute4: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_attraction_model
[5409]: you don't know this because you're not actually part of the lgbt community, you're a tourist.
[*1993] 💗GoldShip🤍: bare pissed mattresses look like a child rapist room but actually pedophiles maintain their shit pretty often, just ask epstein
[5409]: there are the ace umbrella, transsexual umbrella, and general faggot umbrella.
[*1804] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: 5409 are you cis or normal

[*2447] Catzcute4: 5409 what shape is earth
[*1993] 💗GoldShip🤍: also i'm a nudist actually
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: more likely that cc4 did, given he's claiming that
[*2447] Catzcute4: ^
[5409]: i know more than him though.
[*2447] Catzcute4: ok?
[5409]: can you even name a SINGLE site used at the time by the lgbt community

[*2447] Catzcute4: well 5409, what does the heisenberg uncertainty principle state about time and energy
[5409]: you had time to look it up and still didn't post anything, which means you know nothing.
[5409]: so you're posting about other things now.
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yo yo who said cc4 was looking up what the lgbt community was doing *at the time*??
[*2447] Catzcute4: hi
[5409]: your "research" is reading a list of made up pronouns and not engaging in the community.
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: made up shi

[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: idk why we're even discussing this bruh

[5409]: you are tourists to the lgb community. lgbt.
[*2447] Catzcute4: “lgb”
[*7995] 🝦 kipisi Lime: cc4 is aromantic, in which he did not mean asexual*
[5409]: you don't know anything about it.

[*4944] (Admin) Voyeur: it would kill the universe
[*372] Catzcute4: and there’s no real way for them to slow down enough, gravitational waves won’t work either since it’d take too long at the distances they get usually
[*372] Catzcute4: yet, black holes do collide.

[*8900] Catzcute4: hi
[*8900] Catzcute4: tpt better
[*8900] Catzcute4: hi
[8298]: False
[8298]: Both have pros and cons
[*8900] Catzcute4: nah
[*8900] Catzcute4: sandboxels doesn’t have VELOCITY
[8298]: Sandboxels has: active development, more mods, structures, drag tool, way more elements
[8298]: >Catzcute4: sandboxels doesn’t have VELOCITY
[*8900] Catzcute4: ok? but tpt is much more realistic, visually cool, and big in actual size
[*2483] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: go to /movienight2
[8298]: Use velocity2.js
[*4246] Catzcute4: ok but vel2js doesn’ work with drag
[*4246] Catzcute4: and it’s very buggy
[8298]: The dev plans to implement it later
[*4246] Catzcute4: ok but still tho
[*4246] Catzcute4: can you build a computer in sandboxels?
[*2483] 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐚'𝐕𝐢: bye
