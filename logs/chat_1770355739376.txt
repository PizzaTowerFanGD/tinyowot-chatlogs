[12]: barbarity is not related to ancestry but to behavior
[12]: hi schjessu
[3273]: l
[6624]: nigga if its related to behavior then that makes schjessu a groomer and a pedophile
[12]: on what grounds do you say that
[*7689] Holy-Terrorist: ./mute 6624
[12]: i am not saying you are wrong but i demand evidence
[6624]: constnatly posts boykisser
[6624]: boykisser is also a symbol used by pedophiles
[6624]: eg: nolimitspedia, a wiki named after NoLimitsFun (a cp site ran by known pedophile Peter Scully)
[*8570] Schjessu: i just like the character :<
[6624]: on there they'd constnatly show animal gore, advocacy for child pornography and love for illegal content
[*8824] c00lkidd+007n7=plead_forsaken: I changed the username! ;)
[6624]: another example would be roblox groomer groups
[6624]: iirc theyve used boykisser before
[*8570] Schjessu: nolimitspedia can burn in hell
[6624]: and eitherway schjessu is a tranny
[6624]: so they probably groo mkids
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: man when the fuck did transgender get connected to pedophilia
[6624]: when trannies get outed for pedophilia
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i don't get it bruh every time it's some "more likely!" (0.5%) or some loud majority
[*8570] Schjessu: its cuz sm people need to feel superior so they hate on minorities
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: or some stupid pedo hiding under trans to accuse transphobia
[*7689] Holy-Terrorist: 6624 are distorting the words
[6624]: pedophiles are a minority so what is your point schjessu
[12]: it's connected because right-wingers assume that all non-normative sexualities are the same thing
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: PFFFF
[6624]: that we cant also hate on pedophiles despite them being demons in human skin
[*8570] Schjessu: nay
[*8570] Schjessu: pedophiles are trash
[6624]: come on, give me an example of why hating trannies is abd
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: no we can hate on people who act on pedophilic beliefs
[*8570] Schjessu: trans ppl arent
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and people who try to normalise pedophilia
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: fuck pedophilia
[*8570] Schjessu: ^
[9630]: yo guys we got an eye
[9630]: they spying on us
[*8085] Catzcute4: what the heck happened while I was gone, I was just adding code to make every single color dither pattern I can think of in my paster
[6624]: schjessu are you gonna give me a reason on why hating trannies is bad
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: now what i have an issue with is confusing "you don't have to subscribe with the gender binary" and "you need to change gender now"
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: subscribe to*
[*8085] Catzcute4: trans did nothing wrong
[*8570] Schjessu: cuz its hating on innocent ppl
[*8085] Catzcute4: ^
[*8570] Schjessu: what catzcute said
[*7812] prohibit: BREAKING NEWS: binary cell organism dies at age 441 near spawn
[*8085] Catzcute4: ok
[6624]: if theyre innocent, then that'd make pedophiles who havent actually acted on their beliefs innocent too
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hating on people *because they're trans* is inefficient and misguided
[6624]: becuase they arent legally criminals, therefor theyre innocent i nthe law's eye
[6624]: so what is your point?
[*8085] Catzcute4: pedos do bad things to kids, trans people didn’t do anything, and pedos are literally criminals
[*8570] Schjessu: i dont support thoughtcrime
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: shush 6624, you know she meant "trans people aren't not innocent for being trans"
[*8085] Catzcute4: anyways idea: do the google brainfuck abiogenesis experiment on owot (yes that’s a real thing)
[6624]: thoughtcrime is the same thing used by dictators to say those who oppose them are horrible
[*8570] Schjessu: all pedos should seek mental help from their thetapist, not from random teens online
[*8085] Catzcute4: theta
[*8570] Schjessu: therapist*
[*8085] Catzcute4: θpist
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hating on people *cuz they're trans* is bad
[6624]: so therefor hating trannies is thoughtcrime, and not truly a crime
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i'll say that
[*8570] Schjessu: what
[6624]: i hate trannies because they prove time and time again they are pedophiles
[*8085] Catzcute4: repaste done and nothing changed, I’ll try KS2
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: hating is a feeling, acting on those feelings can't be thoughtcrimed
[*8570] Schjessu: >[6624]: i hate trannies because they prove time and time again they are pedophiles
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > i hate trannies because they prove time and time again they are pedophiles
[*8570] Schjessu: proof?
[6624]: remember when that one tranny organized a orgy infront of an ice center
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: you hate (some) trans people because they're pedos?
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: then fucking hate the pedos
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: gosh
[6624]: in the middle of a public street
[*8570] Schjessu: hate the pedos not all trans ppl
[6624]: doesnt that seem kind of
[6624]: idk
[6624]: PEDOPHILIC?
[12]: even if that were true, 6624, you first joined this conversation by advocating genocide, so you're not exactly covered in glory yourself
[*8570] Schjessu: ???
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: > remember when that one tranny organized a orgy infront of an ice center
[6624]: to have sex in the middle of a fucking street
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: well hate that one, not people completely unaffiliated
[*8085] Catzcute4: yeah 6624 you think hitler is good

[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: ,/s/ /m/ /h/
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i'm wasting my time
[6624]: see you arent allowed to hate all nazis
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: gonna animate
[6624]: because not all of them go on their beliefs
[*8085] Catzcute4: and 662r, since some humans are pedos, by your logic, shouldn’t we hate every single human as much as pedos or genocidal people
[6624]: not all of them enact what brenton terrant did
[*8085] Catzcute4: ok 6624 is somewhat right, but most nazis are bad. most trannies are not bad.
[*7689] Holy-Terrorist: It is you, Juno?
[*7689] Holy-Terrorist: 6624
[6624]: most trannies are bad
[*8570] Schjessu: how
[6624]: like how with furries
[*8085] Catzcute4: thus, we can hate on nazis in general, but hating on trannies is bad
[6624]: both communities are degenerates

[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: yes, let's not generalise nazis and racists
[*8085] Catzcute4: i know a trans person IRL

[6624]: i hear all of the people there are woke
[*8570] Schjessu: i dont go to those subsections

[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and same for racists
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: so yes. we can't generalise either.
[6624]: i support jews being killed

[*8085] Catzcute4: (

[*8085] Catzcute4: why
[*8570] Schjessu: why
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: why

[*8085] Catzcute4: yet you don’t generalize nazis?

[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: That's a horrible gibberish
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Also, Lime, where did this character come from: 🝦
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: juno that was an imitation of the wikipedia ipa preview.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Oh, okay
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: it doesn't mean anything. it's gibberish i don't see how it's horrible either.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: anyway i drew a lime slice in tell.wtf and i got this
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: okay I'm sorry, it's those consonant IPA audio recordings.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: like ta ata, ba aba, or whatever.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: smth i like to do is to give up all my assumptions, and get to a conclusion from scratch
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Wait a minute, 🝦 is an alchemical symbol

[1183]: BRO
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: juno, i challenge you to do that
[1183]: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
[1183]: WHAT THE FUCK
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: with one of your beliefs

[4408]: glad you're going through with it
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: try to get to "hrt should be allowed for trans people" using the strategy i described
[4408]: glad lime's getting you into it too
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: 4408, I'm not a troon
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: given that trans people are still people, just with gender problems;
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I don't even do HRT since (((HRT))) is a Jewish thing.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: (wrong)
[4408]: oh but you're a jew right
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: So stop lying about it
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: given that hrt when prescribed to trans people gives much mental health benefits;
[4408]: a trans jew black woman?
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I'm a straight-oriented person and everyone should already FUCKING KNOW IT!!!
[*3816] Catzcute4: jews are ok
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: And I'm not a "trans jew black woman" like that 4408 is claiming
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: 4408 stop you're distracting him from getting closer to getting out of his indocrination

[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I'm a straight white civilized young man.

[8350]: However if you wait long enough, Franklin will eventually show up to defend his home.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Actually, I will never leave my "indoctrination".
[4408]: yes because you love black men
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: No I do not 4408

[*3816] Catzcute4: hi
[*3816] Catzcute4: chat wasn’ actually cleared
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i have a challenge for you; drop *all* assumptions, pretend you've never known a topic; and try to get to a conclusion about that topic from scratch
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: unless if you type /block anon
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: How about Y-DNA haplogroup badges
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: consider contradictory evidence, and attempt to identify logical fallacies, and your biases
[8350]: black men are amazing you love them ik u do juno
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Well, imagine if everyone had a single letter stamp on their passports indicating their race.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: do not twist evidence, like cherrypicking, or using a tiny dataset
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: are you up for the challenge? your prompt is: "gay people should be ostracised"
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and another one: "hrt should be given to trans people"
[*6161] place_holdrr: i think juno should be sent to xen
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: (((HRT))) should not be given to trannies
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: you may add caveats to your conclusion if you feel your conclusion would fare slightly better with them
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: no, juno, my challenge was, you have to get to that conclusion,
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: while abandoning ALL assumptions,
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: https://soyjakwiki.org/HRT
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and starting COMPLETELY from scratch
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Hormone Replacement Therapy, abbreviated as HRT, is a series of drugs created by the (((Jews))) which are best known for magically changing your gender or something. Usually, trannies take female hormones (estrogens), while pooners take male hormones (testosterone). Some of the effects of HRT include fertility loss, making this essentially poison. It's what makes a YWNBAW a real woman.
[*3816] Catzcute4: ok, let’s say: we want to make people satisfied with their physical form
[*3816] Catzcute4: then hrt is a good thing for trans people, because without it, there’s a disconnect (“dysphoria”) between the physical and mental forms
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: It also has an almost divine and religious significance to troons. It of course has terrifying permanent consequences on the health and many do it despite all the downsides, because the feeling of being recognized and proving loyalty to your online identity and the crude promised so-called "upsides" are simply outweighed by the negatives. Many troons are also very mentally vulnerable, thus they ar
[*3816] Catzcute4: i think
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: shh we can read
[6644]: lime you're a fucking dumbass for arguing with a retard who uses soyjakwiki for references
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: thus they are often prone to being misinformed or brainwashed by their peers to undergo the procedure, sometimes going as far as writing the date when they started HRT in their xitter/troonsky/groomcord bio like it's their birthday.
[*3816] Catzcute4: dude prove that jews are bad
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: juno can you like not paste the entire damn article we can follow a link
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Alright
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Fine
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: But I'm also focused onto Y-DNA groups
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: catz, attack the weak points, he's not gonna fold on that
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: And classifying the giving of badges
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: So...
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I have various badges to give
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i'll give a statement to help you, juno: "the positive mental effects outweigh the negative physical effects of hrt"
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: R, I, N, G, O, D, L, T, G, etc.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: whoops, mentioned G twice
[*6161] place_holdrr: juno you should get topside
[*6161] place_holdrr: i hear soldiers are coming in to rescue us
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I'm ignoring place_holdrr's statements
[*6161] place_holdrr: :(
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: So, I think R should be given to Aryans and Europeans
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: specifically those coming from Yamnaya-type peoples
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: and: "the negative physical effects are often rare, and people taking hrt are usually informed"
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Or anyone who descends from them.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Being an R is a legendary badge.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: =p=
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Fun fact: my Y-DNA haplogroup is most likely to be R1b
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i'm going to go fix some bugs while you yap on
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: let me know when you're ready to take on my challenge
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: N is a badge that will be given to Uralic peoples and to Siberians to prove how inferior they are.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: people who come primarily from the indigenous peoples of Europe (before the Yamnaya-conquest) will be given an I
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: The most obvious example being the Basques
[*3816] Catzcute4: ok, here, juno, you are using the axiom “∀x:(isJew(x)→isBad(x))” (jews are bad). however, you have not proven this claim at all, and this honestly does not work well, since not all jews are bad
[*3816] Catzcute4: the reason people though they were is out of a misunderstanding (actually a lack of understanding) of how the plauge worked
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Anyone who is Arab or Middle Eastern gets a J badge
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: indigenous Caucasians gets a G badge
[*3816] Catzcute4: bruh who cares about badges
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Iranians and Armenians may get an R badge but also G badges sometimes.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: him and nobody else in this chat
[*3816] Catzcute4: juno gets a “fails at being cool” badge
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: For pajeets, Indians, South Asians, whatever
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Well, they are very tainted people
[*3816] Catzcute4: bruh
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Stupid enough to intermarry with the natives.
[*3816] Catzcute4: that’s not a bad thing
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: They are like shitskin Aryans.
[*3816] Catzcute4: any good traits will be bought
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I don't know, why, I might give them an L badge.
[*3816] Catzcute4: it’s like saying “oh people shouldn’t marry because one is a man and one is a women, too different”
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: C badge is given to Turkic-Mongol populations
[*6161] place_holdrr: i dont know why you all even bother trying to change what juno believes in
[*3816] Catzcute4: “useless peice of shit” badge is given to juno
[*6161] place_holdrr: hes proven he cant change before and never will
[*3816] Catzcute4: place holder has a point
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: though because of the genetic diversity of Turko-Mongol Asiatic peoples, they might get different badges.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: T badge given to the Dravidians
[*6161] place_holdrr: in all honesty i just let him be the way he is because at least you get a laugh at him
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: D badge given to the Ainus
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: to research into how indoctrina- ahem ""BASED"" people attempt to defend their claims
[*4347] ScienceGD: Words List By Yenji Yem - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/refs/heads/master/words.txt
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: O badge given to the East and Southeast Asians.
[*6161] place_holdrr: lime
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: O is the badge of shame.
[*6161] place_holdrr: please just stop
[*3816] Catzcute4: why does sciengcegd exist
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: whar
[*6161] place_holdrr: you arent going to get him to change
[*3816] Catzcute4: and juno gets an O
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: that's not my only goal
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Stop it, I'm not Asian
[*6161] place_holdrr: you can continue but i just want to let you know its not going to work
[*3816] Catzcute4: yes you are *snaps paws*
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: No I'm not Asian
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: I already confirmed my haplogroup to be R so.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: But anyway
[*3816] Catzcute4: oh you fool juno, I made the universe I just threw you in
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Back to the story.
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: Q badge is given to the Indigenous Ameircans to tell how inferior they are.
[*1905] 🝦 kipisi Lime: i'm partly doing this to, like i said before, inquire into the ways that people like juno attempt to defend their claims
[*3816] Catzcute4: ^

[*6161] place_holdrr: there are alot of things you should be doing
[*6161] place_holdrr: better things*
[*3816] Catzcute4: i’m also autistic
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: A badge given to Capoids and Western Negroes
[*6161] place_holdrr: well autism is part of the reason
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: and B badge given to Congoids and Eastern Negroids.
[*3816] Catzcute4: probably more of bro’s parents
[*6161] place_holdrr: the major reason is he was born in a racist family
[*6161] place_holdrr: so
[*6161] place_holdrr: thats why
[*6161] place_holdrr: yeah his parents
[*8683] JunoTehPlanet: A nad B badges are the two badges of subhumanness.

[*6160] Schjessu: equal rights or all
[9067]: It's pasting the entire clock for every frame, that seems inefficient
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: And when I mean Africans, I meant, the indigenous Africans
[*6160] Schjessu: juno herself is a mexican btw
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Afrikaners are still white because they are settlers
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Ambiguity of mutt people in classifcation:
[9067]: Indigenous during what period?
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Racially mixed people do not fit my ranks very well.
[*6160] Schjessu: lel
[9067]: Do you believe in evolution?

[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: From that proto-human, came niggers and Boreans

[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: From Boreans/Eurasianids, came Caucasoids, Mongoloids, and Amerinds
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Amerinds came from Mongoloids
[*6160] Schjessu: he believes in BOTH the bible AND science
[*6160] Schjessu: it doesnt get dumber than this
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Examples of mutt people:
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Mestizoes refer to racially mixed people of both European and Amerind origins
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: They are considered a Guranic people because they are half-European half-Mongoloid
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Considering the genetic and overall phenotypical appearances
[*6160] Schjessu: juno why are you so obsessed with ranking black gay ppl?
[9067]: Let me write all that down
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Only some spics can pass as "white enough"
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Making them earn either R or I badges
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: A majority of spics however will get Q badges (the same as Amerinds)
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: And a small minority will get E badges (because they came from niggers)
[9067]: Mixed people bad, but some "white enough" good. So an inconsistent racist as well?
[*4276] 🝦 kipisi Lime: PFFFFHH
[*6160] Schjessu: he cant do his job at racism right

[*6160] Schjessu: ey wait juno drew incest porn too
[*4068] JunoTehPlanet: Most are going to be assigned E badges because they came from blacks
[*6160] Schjessu: add that in :bootiful:
[9067]: I still have doubts between dumb as fuck, or trolling while making shit up as they go along
[*4276] 🝦 kipisi Lime: that was caused by porn addiction i think
[9067]: I'm leaning on both right now
[*4276] 🝦 kipisi Lime: probably the former
[*6160] Schjessu: he drew incest porn of him and his cousin
[*4276] 🝦 kipisi Lime: talks about stormfront, and cites stormfront
